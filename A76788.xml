The first, purest, best and most blessed form and manner of government, prescribed by God, (and recorded in Gods sacred word;) together with the way of entrance, or Gods calling of persons to places of chief government, the great consequence thereof.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Revel.</hi> 19.11. <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>I ſaw heaven open, and behold a white horſe, and he that ſate upon him was called faithful and true, and he judgeth and fighteth righteouſly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Verſ. 12. <hi>And his eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns, and he had a name written, that no man knew but himſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Verſ. 13. <hi>And he was clothed in a garment dipt in blood, and his Name was called, The Word of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Verſ. 14. <hi>And the hoſts which were in Heaven, followed him upon white horſes, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Verſ. 15. <hi>And out of his mouth went a ſharp ſword, that with it he ſhall ſmite the Heathen; and rule them, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From this place (being full of conſolation) I ſhall onely collect this one point of Obſervation, (pertinent to the matter by me intended,) namely, That the whole <hi>hoaſt of Heaven, the bleſſed Angels, the Saints and Children of God,</hi> ſhall have this unmatchable, this exceeding great benefit; namely, They ſhall be guided, ordered, and governed, by the Word of God. All the Hoaſts of Heaven followed the Word of God upon white horſes: Which ſheweth, That this ſhall be the happineſs of the bleſſed Angels and Saints, to be guided by, and ſubject to the Word of God.</p>
            <p>We may eaſily diſcern our own weakneſs, in guiding our ſelves; we all, like ſheep, are apt to go aſtray, and to run into many dangers.</p>
            <p>But God is infinitely wiſe to direct us, he is ſtrong to protect us, he is rich in mercy, abundant in mercy; as the heavens are higher then the earth, ſo is his mercy.</p>
            <p>He likewiſe is able to fill and to ſatisfie our Souls with good things, with him is the well-ſpring of life.</p>
            <p>Glorious things are ſpoken of thee, O thou City of God.</p>
            <p>By this means, namely, by being guided by <hi>God,</hi> we ſhall not need to fear, we may lie down, and reſt in peace, becauſe the Lord is our Keeper; read <hi>Pſal.</hi> 23.</p>
            <p>The conſideration of this leads me further to conſider of <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> amongſt men here on earth.</p>
            <p>Upon diligent enquiry into the revealed will, and minde of <hi>God,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in the ſacred Scriptures; I finde,</p>
            <p>That, on earth, it is a matter of the higheſt concernment to have good <hi>Government,</hi> good <hi>Shepherds,</hi> ſuch as are ſent of <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Search the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and you ſhall find, That when the People en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:117747:3"/> godly, wiſe, faithful <hi>Governors,</hi> they were endowed with many other ſingular and great bleſſings from God.</p>
            <p>On the contrary, when their <hi>Governors</hi> were corrupt, the <hi>People</hi> were diſturbed, oppreſſed, and afflicted.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Scriptures</hi> are ſo full, ſo copious, ſo evident in the proof of this, that I ſhall ſpend the leſs time in <hi>quotations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Read the ſtory of the <hi>Judges,</hi> the book of <hi>Kings,</hi> and the <hi>Chronicles</hi> of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and that (being bleſſed to you by God) will help you clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to diſcern the <hi>truth of this matter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The experience of all Ages will ſhew, That from good and evil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors proceeded the <hi>prosperity and adverſity of the Nations:</hi> Search the <hi>Chronicles</hi> and <hi>Records</hi> of the Ages and Times, from <hi>Moſes</hi> his time, to theſe days wherein we live, and it will evidently appear, That from this principle, from this root, namely from <hi>Government,</hi> aroſe the <hi>prosperity</hi> or <hi>adverſity</hi> of the <hi>People</hi> and <hi>Nations.</hi> If we look but back from the time of King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, we ſhall ſee this <hi>State</hi> toſſed to and fro, ſuitably to thoſe perſons that were the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Governors, and that both in <hi>religious duties</hi> and in other <hi>temporal matters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The experience, the Records of all Ages do abundantly teſtifie (being duly weighed and conſidered) of what great concernment <hi>Government</hi> is of, to render a people bleſſed, or deſpiſed of <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the intent that we may the better and more clearly ſee the ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar benefit that it is, to have a good <hi>Government,</hi> I ſhall propound briefly ſome particulars to conſideration.</p>
            <p>For inſtance, look upon the <hi>univerſal works,</hi> the <hi>Creation of God;</hi> Conſider the Sun how it goeth his due courſe, not failing to perform his great journey, round about this world, in twenty four hours; the Sun knoweth his riſing, and his going down, not altering nor failing one minute of time, nor failing one foot of ground in all his great and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied journeys; <hi>O how excellent are all thy works O God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Conſider likewiſe thoſe excellent vertues and operations with which the Sun is beautified and enriched, as namely,</p>
            <p>Firſt, Light, which ſheweth man the way and work he is to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form; without light Man is miſerable.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Sun heateth the air, and comforteth man, and all creatures.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Sun cauſeth the bud of the herb to ſpring forth, it cauſeth the Corn to grow, whereby man is nouriſhed.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:117747:4"/>
            <p>Now conſider whence or how this creature the Sun is ſo wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and excellently made, is it not from the wiſdom and excellency of the moſt high <hi>God</hi> that made it, and governeth it?</p>
            <p>Now let us but conſider, That if <hi>God</hi> ſhould but with-hold his hand, if <hi>God</hi> ſhould but withdraw himſelf, his wiſdom, his power, his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, his skill, for want of ſuch a Work-maſter, theſe glorious works of <hi>God</hi> would be confuſed and fail.</p>
            <p>This ſheweth, that there is a neceſſity for the well-being of matters of great conſequence, eſpecially (ſuch as are the <hi>Governments</hi> over and amongſt men) that the <hi>Governors</hi> be choſen men; we cannot be too circumſpect what <hi>Governors</hi> we do receive, and that they be men choſen of <hi>God, &amp;c.</hi> If we err in this <hi>Governor,</hi> we ſhall finde that great trouble will follow.</p>
            <p>Conſider likewiſe the <hi>Stars</hi> of Heaven, which although they are to us innumerable, yet every <hi>Star</hi> hath his proper place; they go their appointed journeys and courſes, which they keep without jarring or alteration, performing thoſe operations to them appointed.</p>
            <p>Conſider likewiſe the Tydes, how they do ebb and flow, keeping within the limits of time and proportion; Thus far they flow, and ſo return, in their due and appointed ſeaſons.</p>
            <p>And doth not this come to paſs from the excellency and perfection of that <hi>God</hi> that created, and is the <hi>Governor</hi> of them?</p>
            <p>Conſider likewiſe amongſt men, in every great and uſeful work, if the guide and governor of the work be skilful and able, doth not the work committed to him proſper proportionably?</p>
            <p>On the contrary, if a fooliſh man, a diſordered perſon, have the government in chief of ſuch matters, are they not likely to fail and be confuſed?</p>
            <p>Conſider likewiſe in a Ship, when the Maſter is godly, wiſe, skilful, and able, is not the Voyage by him likely to come to good iſſue?</p>
            <p>But on the contrary, if a fooliſh, diſordered, unjuſt man be the Maſter, is not the undertaking endangered, if not overthrown?</p>
            <p>And is not this matter, namely, the <hi>Government of a Common-wealth,</hi> to be looked upon with as much regard?</p>
            <p>Ought not men to be very heedful and circumſpect, who, and what manner of perſons they accept to govern them?</p>
            <p>Doth not this matter immediately concern <hi>Gods glory?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Doth it not concern the good and comfort of our Souls, of our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, of our Eſtates, and of our Children?</p>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:117747:4"/>
            <p>Yes certainly, the matter is of great concernment.</p>
            <p>And yet are we not to lament this, namely, That men oft ruſh up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the chuſing of <hi>Governors,</hi> as the horſe into the battel, with too little fear or wit?</p>
            <p>Men are too much of theſe tempers:</p>
            <p>Firſt, Either they will admit of no <hi>Government,</hi> whence ſpringeth miſery, confuſion, and every evil work; by this means ſome ſay, as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ſaid to <hi>Moſes, Exod.</hi> 5.2. <hi>Who is the Lord, that I ſhould hear his voyce, and let Iſrael go? I know not the Lord, neither will I let Iſrael go.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus will it be with many who acknowledg none to be their Rulers.</p>
            <p>And ſome <hi>David</hi> ſpeaketh of, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 12.4. who ſay in their hearts, <hi>Our tongues are our own, who is Lord over us?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe men know not what they do, they deſire that which would aſſuredly make them miſerable: But of this in another place, if God will.</p>
            <p>Or ſecondly, Others they deſire to have Government, but they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider not of how great concernment Government is of.</p>
            <p>Hence it comes to paſs, that like the people in <hi>Samuels</hi> time, men will have a King, they will have a Governor, not duly weighing and conſidering what maner of Governor they deſire; whether he be godly, or ungodly; whether he be wiſe, or fooliſh; whether he be a man ſent of God, or a man of their own inordinate deſires; whether he come in (to be the true Shepherd) by the door of Gods Word, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the rule there preſcribed, or whether he come in at the window, or creep in ſome other way, by friends, beauty, riches, eloquence, fraud, flattery: Thus lamentable experience teacheth us, hath been the practiſe of the People and Nations, from the time of <hi>Samuel</hi> to this day, too often.</p>
            <p>Hence it cometh to paſs, that ſo many Wolves enter into the ſheep-fold, who miſerably devour, perſecute, deſtroy the ſheep.</p>
            <p>The conſideration of theſe miſeries, which ariſe from, and attend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe people that have wolves in ſheeps clothing inſtead of true Shepherds, occaſions us to ſearch and enquire what may be the true ground or fountain whence this evil ſpringeth.</p>
            <p>There are two main and principal Cauſes which occaſioned God to ſuffer <hi>Jſrael</hi> to be ſo miſled, ſo ſeduced, ſo deceived, ſo afflicted.</p>
            <p>The one Reaſon was, Becauſe the people ſlighted, diſ-eſteemed, and undervalued this pearl of great price, namely, to have God to be their
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:117747:5"/> King, and to have him immediately to chooſe their Governors for them.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Reaſon was, Becauſe the people did not diligently ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, and cleave to the Commandments of God, but inſtead thereof, they followed their own inventions.</p>
            <p>And if we ſhall warily conſider, what the cauſe hath been, and is, why the People and Nations have done, and do ſo miſcarry in their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, it ariſeth from theſe two fore-named Grounds, namely, the ſlighting Gods Mercies, and departing from preſcribed Rules.</p>
            <p>For the firſt of theſe read <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.11, to 16. where God admoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them to take heed, and to beware, leſt when they had abundance, when they had eaten, and were full, that they did not then ſlight, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſteem, or forget God.</p>
            <p>Reaſon God gave them in this admonition, as namely, becauſe <hi>verſ.</hi> 12. God brought them out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> out of a low condition; <hi>verſ.</hi> 15. and becauſe God was a jealous God among them, and leſt the wrath of God were kindled againſt them to deſtroy them. Notwithſtanding thoſe and many other Exhortations and Cautions which the Lord from time to time laid before them to warn them, yet they ſoon and often turned aſide from God the Fountain of living water, and digged to themſelves broken Ciſterns, that would not hold good water.</p>
            <p>And touching the ſecond, namely, their departing from the Rules preſcribed, <hi>Moſes</hi> did often admoniſh them, as in this <hi>Chapter, verſ.</hi> 16. <hi>Ye ſhall not tempt the Lord your God, &amp;c.</hi> Verſ. 17. But <hi>you ſhall keep diligently the Commandments of the Lord your God, and his Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and his Ordinances, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Dearly beloved, this is very apparent, That Government is of very great concernment: Therefore it is to be prized at a great value. We ought, with great diligence, to ſeek and to ſearch the Scriptures, that ſo we may find the right and pure way preſcribed, owned and bleſſed by God for the choice of our Governors.</p>
            <p>By this means we ſhall obtain a bleſſing from God, we ſhall have true Shepherds, we ſhall diſcover wolves in ſheeps clothing, who ſlily creep in to devour and to deſtroy: If God ſo often willeth us to take heed to keep all his Commands, then certainly this, which is of ſo great concernment, is not to be ſlighted, but valued at a high price.</p>
            <p>Now to the end that we may more deeply imprint this in our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and that we may never forget the great good and benefit of good Government, it behoves us to conſider what ſhould be the Reaſon that
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:117747:5"/> God permitteth ſuch corrupt Governors to be in the world. It is not becauſe God wants either Power, Wiſdom, or Will to do us good? for as a father pitieth his children, ſo, and much more is our Gods favor toward us. And as the Heavens are higher then the Earth, ſo is his Mercy, &amp;c. God is of great bounty, abundant in goodneſs, rich in mercy. If it be ſo, as it is certainly ſo, then we may learn this, That the cauſe why God ſuffereth us to err in this matter of Government, is for his Glory, and for our learning, for our good.</p>
            <p>Good things are beſt ſeen to be good by their contraries.</p>
            <p>The benefit of light is beſt diſcerned when we have been in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>The abſence of the Sun and cold in Winter, cauſeth us to value the benefit of his nearer preſence in the Summer.</p>
            <p>The full loatheth the hony-comb, but to the hungry bitter things ſeem ſweet.</p>
            <p>When God brought <hi>Jſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> he could have brought them to <hi>Canaan</hi> a nearer way.</p>
            <p>God ſeeth it meet, that we muſt ſow in tears, before we reap in joy.</p>
            <p>God placed <hi>Adam,</hi> our Grandfather, in happineſs, he valued an apple at a higher price then Gods favor, therefore God made him to know ſorrow, that ſeeing the difference, he might be more wary afterwards, and value better things according to their worth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iſrael</hi> was Gods firſt born Son, and God beſtowed this favor (not to be enough valued) upon them, namely this, That he did immediately appoint the perſons that ſhould govern them. But <hi>Iſrael</hi> were full, and fat, they were wanton, and ſlighted Gods mercy in this matter: Therefore God ſuffered them to reap the fruit of their inventions.</p>
            <p>They diſliked that form of Government which God had preſcribed, which God had owned and bleſſed.</p>
            <p>They would alter that form of Government appointed by God, namely that of Judges, and they would have a King.</p>
            <p>Againſt this form of Government by Kings <hi>God</hi> expreſly declared his diſlike; for here note, it was not about the perſon, but about the form of <hi>Government,</hi> the difference lay directly between <hi>Government</hi> by Judges, and <hi>Government</hi> by Kings. They were at the firſt content that <hi>God</hi> ſhould chooſe the perſon, and to make him King, who the Lord their <hi>God</hi> choſe: But, after they fell more groſly, they choſe Kings them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, without enquiring of <hi>God;</hi> as I purpoſe, if <hi>God</hi> will, to ſhew afterwards.</p>
            <pb n="8" facs="tcp:117747:6"/>
            <p>Well conſider we of it, <hi>God gave them a King in his wrath, &amp;c.</hi> Note well what <hi>God</hi> ſaith, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.47, 48. <hi>Becauſe thou ſervedſt not the Lord thy God with joyfulneſs, and with a good heart, for the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of all things:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Therefore thou ſhalt ſerve thy enemies in hunger, and in thirſt, and in nakedneſs, and in need of all things, and he ſhall put a yoke of iron upon thy neck, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beloved friends, Let us not caſt away our Reaſon, that noble faculty of our Souls: conſider that both they and we have had a long and large experience of the difference between Judges and Kings.</p>
            <p>Compare thoſe Judges of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> before Kings were, with thoſe Kings that were after them.</p>
            <p>Conſider this, That of, or amongſt thoſe Judges immediately ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by God, from <hi>Moſes</hi> to <hi>Samuel,</hi> there was not one of them but were bleſſed by God, his good Spirit helped them to judg righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly.</p>
            <p>Secondly, God made them a bleſſing to the People; they did not addict themſelves to voluptuous pleaſure, nor to build ſtately Palaces, not to idolatrous wives; not to many wives, not to voluptuous diet, or much wine, not to multiplicity of attendants, not to Plays, Paſtimes, Hawking and Hunting; not to Oppreſſion of their Brethren, not to idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, not to ſwearing &amp; profaneneſs. They did not nouriſh, and promote and put great Titles of Honor upon men, and keep company with ſuch moſt familiarly, which openly and often blaſphemed and deſpiſed God, the moſt high God, by ſwearing, revelling, whoring, and what not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneneſs? nor did thoſe bleſſed Judges neglect the due adminiſtration of Juſtice and Judgment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> But what did theſe Judges then? What manner of perſons were they?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Firſt, Note that God ſent them; they came into the ſheepfold by the door, by <hi>Gods</hi> appointment, they did not creep ſlighly in by beauty, friends, eloquence, mony, indiſcreet Elections of the people, not by any unjuſt fraud or force.</p>
            <p>Hence it came to paſs, that <hi>God</hi> bleſſed them with a good portion of his good and bleſſed Spirit; <hi>God</hi> owned them.</p>
            <p>Hence it came to paſs likewiſe, That the ſheep owned them, and willingly obeyed their voyce, and followed them in the paths of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs.</p>
            <p>Theſe Judges likewiſe loved the People: ſee how <hi>Moſes</hi> intercedes,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:117747:6"/> and pleads with God, by prayer and ſupplication for them.</p>
            <p>Oh, it is a precious benefit to people, to enjoy godly Governours.</p>
            <p>Theſe Judges were humble, meek, painfull, they did not ſwell with conceit that their veins were full of Royal bloud.</p>
            <p>For they ſtill acknowledg the people to be their brethren.</p>
            <p>It's ſaid of <hi>Moſes</hi> when <hi>Jethro</hi> came to ſee him, that he judged the people from morning to evening.</p>
            <p>And afterwards his burthen, or charge, was not laid aſide (by <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thro's</hi> counſel only) it was eaſed.</p>
            <p>It is ſaid of <hi>Samuel,</hi> That beſides the pains he took (where he dwelt) in judging the people, he likewiſe went about and judged the people in other places, year by year.</p>
            <p>Now dear friends, concerning the fruits that came by Kings, I appeal to God, to his ſacred word, to the Records, to the Chronicles, to the experience both of our own and other Nations, whether Kings have been to be compared with thoſe Judges: have not Kings been addicted to thoſe vices, and very empty of ſuch graces as were requiſite for men in ſuch eminent places? For though ſome may cavil, and object, that ſome Kings were good, I ſhall (if God permit and aſſiſt) anſwer, I hope to ſatisfaction, both this, and all other objections that I have yet heard of, and can remember, that tend to confirm and ſtrengthen the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance, and beings of Kings amongſt us.</p>
            <p>Becauſe I judge that from evident grounds plainly laid down in the ſacred Scriptures, the word of God, the moſt true, and the moſt uner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring rule to direct us.</p>
            <p>Kings were neither the firſt, nor the beſt way of Government.</p>
            <p>Conſider likewiſe thoſe precious promiſes of God, who hath not left us without hope, for the word of God ſeemeth to me, plainly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare and ſhew, that in theſe laſt days (which days and times (I believe to be) theſe verytimes, or times very near approaching, as by the opinion of many Godly and learned men) in which God will deſtroy corrupt Government, and Governors, and will exalt his mountain in the top of the Mountains, and will give and reſtore to us, Judges, as at the firſt, and Counſellors, as at the beginning.</p>
            <p>Afterwards <hi>thou ſhalt be called a City of righteouſneſs, a faithful City,</hi> Iſai. 1.25, 26, 27. &amp; ch. 2.2, 3, 4.</p>
            <p>Of this I purpoſe to ſpeak more afterwards.</p>
            <p>Dearly beloved friends, thus much I can and do affirm to you all in the preſence of that all-ſeeing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>od, who will bring hidden things, deeds
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:117747:7"/> of darkneſs to light, even in the preſence of that God who I do <hi>Love, Fear, Worſhip,</hi> who is my <hi>Hope,</hi> my <hi>Joy,</hi> from whom I received all the <hi>Good</hi> I have, from whom I expect my comfort for the time to come.</p>
            <p>I have not (ſo far as I know my own heart) any prejudice nor reſpect of perſons, nor any paſt, preſent, or future, by, or ſiniſter reſpect, in the writing this little <hi>Treatiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have never received the value of one penny in recompence of my endeavors, and for the time to come, I am ſo far from thoughts that way, That I do expect rather that I ſhall receive injury hereby, and that this may be a great hinderance to me in wordly reſpects, only this is my comfort, <hi>That</hi> I <hi>know whom</hi> I <hi>have truſted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this further can I ſay likewiſe, That at the writing hereof I know not, nor did ever ſee, either thoſe truly honourable Generals, the Lord <hi>Fairfax,</hi> nor the Lord <hi>Cromwel,</hi> nor any Captain or Souldier amongſt them, except ſome few I lately ſaw in, or neer to <hi>London,</hi> as I paſſed by them, nor do I know any one of them if I ſee them again, ſo far as I conceive.</p>
            <p>It is poſſible ſome of my acquaintance may be in the Army, but if it be ſo, I know it not.</p>
            <p>And concerning thoſe worthy men (for ſo I eſteem them to be) that now ſit in the <hi>Parliament,</hi> I never ſaw any one of them (to my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg) except one who I have ſeen, I think, three or four times, yet I know not certainly whether he be of the Parliament or no, only I think he is.</p>
            <p>Whereas I affirm that I know not any of the Army, or of the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi> I intend that I know not the perſons of the men, but by their fruits, I know much concerning them.</p>
            <p>Some may judge this to be ſuperfluous to mention, but I ſhall ſhew you what moveth me ſo to do.</p>
            <p>In diſcourſing with divers men, I find, to my beſt apprehenſion, That there is ſuch a crooked and perverſe generation of men, that imagine miſchief, that invent baſe, falſe, and ſlanderous reports againſt <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Generals, Army,</hi> and indeed, againſt the moſt that truly fear God.</p>
            <p>Blame me not therefore (courteous Reader) if I labour to prevent ſlanderous and lying Tongues.</p>
            <p>And this likewiſe I affirm, That with due regard of Gods preſence, in the fear of God, (being much ſenſible of my own weakneſs, ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:117747:7"/> conſidering of how great weight it is to write books and to preſent them to publique view) I am very fearful to preſume above what is meet: and this I ſay further, that my purpoſe is to propound the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and cauſes I ſhall principally inſiſt upon in this following <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I purpoſe likewiſe, according to the meaſure of light, grace, and opportunity that God ſhall give me, to prove and clear the matters pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, and then having preſented the cauſe, I ſhall earneſtly deſire of God to ſtir ſome perſons (who are more learned and better able then my ſelf) and to enable and direct them ſo, That they may more largely and clearly ſhew forth to publique view, the mind of God in theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Government,</hi> and <hi>Governors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is now a long ſeaſon that the Nations have been ſo kept under by <hi>Corrupt Governors,</hi> above two thouſand years; during which time, where (or who) was the man that durſt, or did punctually diſcover the <hi>Corruption of Governors,</hi> or of <hi>Government.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. This is one reaſon that moveth me to preſent the cauſe to publike view, namely becauſe I know not, or do not diſcern that any one wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, from <hi>Samuels</hi> days to this time (the pens of the Scriptures excepted) that hath punctually written upon this ſubject.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This is another moving cauſe, becauſe now being a time of more <hi>Liberty,</hi> and conſidering that I, my children, and poſterity are concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the caſe of <hi>Government,</hi> I conceive there is reaſon good why I ſhould preſent this cauſe to publike conſideration.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This is another motive, I look upon the great effuſion of bloud that hath been ſhed about this matter, the cauſe (for ought I know) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not yet wholy determined, but is ſtill ſo, that (I conceive) that our <hi>godly Governors</hi> are ready to prefer Gods glory and the common good, before their own intereſts, in thoſe matters that they ſhall clearly ſee to be the mind and will of God.</p>
            <p n="4">4. This is another motive, ſeeing apparently our miſerable condition, people being divided in judgment, and in affection, ſo that our condition is much like a ſhip in a Tempeſt. Therefore the end of my endeavors ſhall be (ſo far as God ſhall aſſiſt) that I may reconcile differences, and that Peace and Truth may meet together, as <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the mount of God, and kiſſed each other. And as this is the end I propound to my ſelf, ſo likewiſe I purpoſe it ſhall be the <hi>Title</hi> or <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſcription.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="12" facs="tcp:117747:8"/>
            <p>Dearly beloved friends, all you that love and fear the <hi>Lord,</hi> all you that have obtained like precious faith, I earneſtly intreat you to aſſiſt me in this work with your prayers, with your moſt beſt, uttermoſt, and ſtrongeſt abilities. <hi>Contend for the truth in love, but ſtrive not, luſt not to be contentious.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Reject not that <hi>Truth,</hi> that <hi>Good</hi> wholy, which is accompanied with ſome blemiſhes.</p>
            <p>Men caſt not away a good garment, becauſe of a little dirt.</p>
            <p>Conſider the great differences and troubles about <hi>Governors and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</hi> Therefore I humbly requeſt thee to weigh, try, prove, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine, ſearch the Scripture, cleave to the <hi>Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Seek the favour of God with more then ordinary prayer, That the <hi>good &amp; holy Spirit of God</hi> may lead thee into <hi>truth.</hi> For it is evident that many <hi>unclean Spirits,</hi> many <hi>falſe</hi> and <hi>lying Spirits,</hi> are permitted to <hi>deceive many in theſe our days.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This point of <hi>Government</hi> is of great concernment; if God help us to diſcern the <hi>good and right way</hi> (preſcribed, practiſed, owned, and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by God) to chuſe perſons, ſo that God may be ſaid to chuſe for us; to ſhut up all windows and by-ways, that ſo <hi>Wolves, Foxes and beaſts of prey</hi> may be kept from the Sheep: If God help us to diſcern the way, <hi>the true and right way,</hi> and in that way to ſet open the door, that the good and true <hi>Shepherds</hi> may enter, whoſe <hi>fruits</hi> will ſoon diſcover them to be <hi>good and true Shepherds,</hi> for they will love the flock, they will watch over them (not for the fleece moſtly) but to defend them from <hi>beasts of prey:</hi> Theſe good <hi>Shepherds</hi> will ſeek the <hi>comfort of the Flock,</hi> they will drive them to the <hi>wholeſom paſtures,</hi> and to the <hi>ſtill waters,</hi> where they may be refreſhed, where they may <hi>bleſs the name of the Lord,</hi> and lie down without fear, <hi>(for true love caſteth out fear)</hi> and ſo <hi>reſt in peace,</hi> becauſe <hi>a good Shepherd is their watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Was not this the very foundation and cauſe that <hi>David (Pſ.</hi> 23.) found ſuch <hi>great comfort and refreſhment,</hi> namely from his <hi>Shepherd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Dear Friends, if God help us to obtain good <hi>Shepherds,</hi> good <hi>Governors,</hi> our ſtrife will end, our differences will be compoſed: Corrupt Opinions on the one hand, and deſperate Blaſphemy and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneneſs on the other hand, will vaniſh as ſmoak before the winde. The very preſence of <hi>Moſes</hi> deſtroyed the <hi>profaneneſs of Idolatrous Worſhip.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Dear Chriſtian Friends, if God help us in <hi>this matter,</hi> then ſhall
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:117747:8"/> 
               <hi>peace and truth meet together,</hi> and as <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> they ſhall kiſs one another in the <hi>Mount of God.</hi>

            <p>Then ſhall we well provide for the <hi>comfort of our children,</hi> and for their <hi>poſterity.</hi> Then ſhall the <hi>generations to come</hi> have cauſe to bleſs us.</p>
            <p>Then ſhall <hi>the Name of the Lord</hi> be praiſed with <hi>joyful hearts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then ſhall the Lord bleſs us, and we ſhall be bleſſed.</p>
            <p>I ſhall endeavor to write, in this enſuing <hi>Treatiſe,</hi> without <hi>partiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> without <hi>turning to the right, or to the left hand,</hi> without <hi>respect of perſons,</hi> further then, in <hi>a way of righteouſneſs,</hi> accept of this my <hi>mite.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And let thoſe men who have received more <hi>abilities,</hi> and <hi>opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> put more into the <hi>Treaſury.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Dear Friends and Country-men, I dare not ſay, that for your ſakes I could be content to have my name blotted out of the <hi>Book of Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor, with <hi>Paul, That for this cauſe, I could be content to be a caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>away from the preſence of God for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the thought of that would be more bitter then <hi>death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this I do ſay, That (ſo far as I know my own <hi>heart</hi>) (provided that the loſs of my <hi>temporal life</hi> would be the means to procure this happineſs to you, namely, that you might poſſeſs <hi>Judges</hi> as the firſt, and <hi>Counſellors</hi> as at the beginning) I could be content to lay down this <hi>temporal life</hi> that for a little ſeaſon I do here enjoy.</p>
            <p>Beloved Friends, I conſidering that there is ſo <hi>great a diſtance</hi> at this time between <hi>Opinions,</hi> but more eſpecially there is a greater dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the <hi>affections</hi> of many; I ſhall deſire leave of the <hi>courteous Reader,</hi> that without offence I may propound ſome other <hi>matters</hi> to conſideration: My ends therein are, that I may extinguiſh that heat (if not wholly, yet in ſome meaſure) that is burning or ſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering in the hearts of many.</p>
            <p>For otherwiſe theſe will lie as a block, or as a bar in the way, to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that <hi>peace and truth</hi> ſhould not meet together.</p>
            <p>I remember <hi>Jacob</hi> his example herein, he being intended and deſirous to be reconciled to his brother <hi>Eſau,</hi> who had determined or threatned his <hi>death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He labors to prevent and pacifie his brothers anger, by ſending pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents and ſoft anſwers, good words before him.</p>
            <p>Such gifts as I have, I offer to you; Silver and Gold I have but little: I deſire that I may finde the like acceptance that <hi>Jacob</hi> did.</p>
            <pb n="14" facs="tcp:117747:9"/>
            <p>The firſt and great hinderance that I find laid in the way to hinder Peace and Truth from meeting together, is the death of the late King, the removing of divers Lords, and ſome others, from their preſent Being, or acting as Members of that Court, and the pretended wilful breach of a former Covenant.</p>
            <p>I am not deſirous to call back thoſe things that are done and paſt; I am not deſirous to take abroad thoſe imbers in which, wherein, hath been or may be contained coals of fire, that might or may kindle ſuch f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>es as are not eaſily quenched.</p>
            <p>It is better for peace ſake to ſuffer ſome, yea, much wrong, then to endeavor to right our ſelves in ſuch a way, as may turn to far greater loſs.</p>
            <p>Our Saviour counſelleth us, <hi>rather to ſuffer wrong, then to contend in Law; and rather to loſe our garment, then to contend too earneſtly for it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In thoſe things wherein ſin is committed by others, and we no actors nor conſenters in it, we may, in ſome caſes (eſpecially then, when by ſeeking revenge, we may plunge and throw our ſelves <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>to greater dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and temptations,) in ſuch caſes we may wait patiently, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit thoſe caſes to God that judgeth righteouſly.</p>
            <p>Sin ſhall ſlay the wicked doer, and God will bring down the evil and the deceitful men.</p>
            <p>He that riſeth up to right another mans cauſe, muſt look well to his own calling and abilities.</p>
            <p>Did not theſe lie as a bar in the way to hinder Peace and Truth from meeting, I ſhould be ſilent, and commit the matter to him that judgeth righteouſly, and ſo I deſire to do.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not uſe here any carnal weapons, onely make ſome uſe of Truth, (ſo well as I am able) that thereby we may find the way to Peace.</p>
            <p>And firſt, touching the late Kings death, conſider that we cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call that: What then? Are you reſolved to ſet up the eldeſt Son upon the Throne of his Father?</p>
            <p>Conſider well of it; Can you tell whether he will prove wiſe or fooliſh? Can you tell whether he will care for the Flock? Can you tell whether he will love or hate the Flock?</p>
            <p>Can you tell whether you ſhould obtain your deſires? or whether that the purſuance thereof may not be a means to ruine your ſelves, and many others, that deſire to live in peace?</p>
            <pb n="15" facs="tcp:117747:9"/>
            <p>Are you nevertheleſs reſolved to have ſuch a Watchman, ſuch a Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd? Will you expect grapes from thorns?</p>
            <p>I have indeed, to my ſorrow, heard this with my ears lately ſpoken, That if a <hi>Turk,</hi> or any other as bad almoſt, ſhould come hither, and contend for the <hi>Government,</hi> there would be a great party for him: Oh horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble impiety, that men ſhould ſo far be tranſported beyond the bounds of Reaſon and Religion!</p>
            <p>Indeed there is a generation too apparent, that by their works, by their ſwearing, and prophaneneſs, and hatred of thoſe that love and fear the Lord, declare evidently, that they are Gods enemies.</p>
            <p>It is therefore not to be wondred, that God ſhould give them over to ſtrong deluſions, to believe lies.</p>
            <p>What if Gods Word declare evidently, That the Government by Judges be better, more agreeable to his mind, more uſeful, and more comfortable to us, will you nevertheleſs have a King? conſider of it.</p>
            <p>Friends, Countrymen, Beloved, I have no prejudice againſt a King; but this I ſay, I honour, love, worſhip, and deſire to cleave to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts and Commandments (of him that is the King of Kings) of him who gave me life, and is able to raiſe me up to life, when this ſpan of time is paſt, when the King of Terrors hath done his utmoſt ſpite.</p>
            <p>I was no actor in the Kings death, I had taken a great journey above four years before the death of the King, and was many hundreds of miles diſtant from this Land, and returned hither very lately, I ſpeak therefore the more freely, with more liberty.</p>
            <p>I have endeavored, with the greateſt care I could, to weigh mens words and paſſages in the ballance of the Sanctuary, and I find many that ſpeak looſely, careleſly, and many more prophanely.</p>
            <p>Is Government of ſo little concernment to us, that we ſhould ruſh upon men that muſt be our Shepherds, in whoſe hands our lives and comforts muſt be next under God?</p>
            <p>I have heard many Reports touching this perſon whom many do ſo labour after; conſider well what fruits you ſee from that branch, what tokens of godlineſs is there in him? <hi>David</hi> ſaith, That <hi>he loveth thoſe that love the Lord, and hateth thoſe that are Gods enemies:</hi> Read <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.21, <hi>to</hi> 29.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37. <hi>That the end of the juſt man is peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But the tranſgreſſors ſhall be deſtroyed together, and the end of the wicked ſhall be cut off:</hi> Read <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37. and conſider well of it.</p>
            <pb n="16" facs="tcp:117747:10"/>
            <p>Now, is it not apparent, that the perſon ſo much deſired, hath corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondency with Idolaters, and prophane perſons?</p>
            <p>Doth he not love them, and converſe moſt familiarly with many ſuch? Do not his Letters and Intelligences import ſo much?</p>
            <p>Friends, You that are ſo eager, do you know what you ſhould gain, in caſe he were made your Guide and Ruler?</p>
            <p>It is not unlike, but that thoſe perſons which are your enemies, ſhould be made your Judges and Governors, in caſe you obtain your deſires.</p>
            <p>To further this end, there is a Malignant party that hateth thoſe that love and fear the Lord, theſe report, That in the Army there are many Jeſuites countenanced, and that the Parliament and Army prefer and countenance ſuch; amongſt others they mention one Mr <hi>Peters,</hi> who they ſay is a Jeſuite.</p>
            <p>Let us now, as in the preſence of that glorious and ſtrong God (who will one day deſtroy the workers of iniquities, and thoſe that invent, love, and ſow lyes, (as the devil ſoweth the tares to choke the good corn) theſe ſhall feel the fierce anger of God, when they ſhall deſire that the mountains might fall upon them, to hide them from the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous God who loveth the Truth,) let us impartially weigh theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports.</p>
            <p>Firſt for Mr <hi>Peters,</hi> I my ſelf have known the man many years, and I have often heard him preach, I never heard him teach ſuch Doctrines as might give us occaſion to ſuſpect him to adhere to the Jeſuites, his Doctrine was godly and ſound; he is zealous and active, but no way addicted that way; and unto this teſtimony, I doubt not but that, if need require, I can bring the teſtimony of many thouſands.</p>
            <p>But conſider, (unpartial and friendly Reader) it is not on him alone that they lay ſuch calumnies, but on many others, which are eminent for piety and holineſs.</p>
            <p>Now let us a little enquire for the reſt of thoſe many Jeſuites, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Army, upon the beſt intelligence that I am able to get, I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, that the General is truly devout and godly, and that there is not any Jeſuite (known ſo to be) that is either an Officer or a Preacher in the Army.</p>
            <p>And touching the Parliaments favouring Jeſuites, this I experimentally ſee and hear, that in this Kingdom thoſe Miniſters whom they counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and allow chiefly, are ſuch as teach ſound doctrine to my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</p>
            <pb n="17" facs="tcp:117747:10"/>
            <p>And the Royaliſts, in argument (I never heard any but) do acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg ſo much, and I have purpoſely diſcourſed (about that matter) with divers of them.</p>
            <p>This I ſee, that (to my underſtanding) we have juſt cauſe to praiſe God, that the Goſpel is ſo freely preached</p>
            <p>And although ſome leaven of corrupt doctrine be (againſt their minds, as I believe) ſown here and there;</p>
            <p>Yet it is to be conſidered, that their hands are full of buſineſs, they cannot yet reform many matters, (I do undoubtedly believe) they will hereafter reform.</p>
            <p>Countrymen and Friends, let us conſider well of this; do not we, by our gain-ſaying, by our perverſeneſs, by our ſins, hinder the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi> in the work of <hi>Reformation?</hi> And if upon juſt examination we do find our ſelves guilty, let us repent and amend, for God will prove and try all our works.</p>
            <p>In the mean time conſider, that if the contrary <hi>party</hi> ſhould prevail, can they that truly love and fear the Lord by that means expect (eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in ſuch troubleſom times) that they ſhall enjoy more <hi>liberty</hi> to ſerve God aright?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But many complain of <hi>great Taxations,</hi> and that there are defects in the <hi>Adminiſtration of Juſtice;</hi> many Debts unpayd, and the <hi>impotent Poor</hi> unprovided for.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I deſire every man duly and unpartially to conſider, That the Times are troubleſom, many <hi>diſburſements</hi> they have that they cannot avoyd, the Army here and in <hi>Ireland,</hi> the great number of Ships, of Munition, of Proviſions, former Debts, and many other charges, which every man is not ſenſible of; all do hinder, that they cannot do what otherwiſe they would: I hope (and beleeve that it is a <hi>great burthen</hi> and grief to them) that ſuch <hi>burthens and taxations</hi> ſhould be, and I beleeve it is their deſire, their ſtudy and care, to eaſe the <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> and to take off theſe <hi>Taxations,</hi> with what expedition they can; And I am not without hope that God will ſhew them a way ſo to do, (and give them <hi>hearts</hi> to make uſe of it) by which theſe <hi>burthens</hi> may be taken off, and the <hi>People</hi> comforted. And for the other <hi>Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances,</hi> I deſire that we may, for the time being, bear with ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences; I do hope ſhortly we ſhall ſee a <hi>greater Reformation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean time I deſire that we, by our diſtempers, do not weaken their <hi>proceedings,</hi> ſo that they may not effect ſuch <hi>Reformation</hi> as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe they might.</p>
            <pb n="18" facs="tcp:117747:11"/>
            <p>And likewiſe I deſire that we may not, by our gainſaying, both hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thoſe <hi>comforts</hi> we might enjoy, and bring upon our ſelves more and greater Troubles.</p>
            <p>This I take notice of, In the <hi>Country,</hi> ſin goeth on, and is committed with an high hand; ſwearing and curſing, lying and other ſins do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in the ſight of the Sun.</p>
            <p>What ſin is ſtrange? <hi>but for thoſe that fear the Lord, they are an abomination to the wicked.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Conſider this, It is the duty of all men to walk circumſpectly and preciſely, as in the preſence of an holy God.</p>
            <p>Therefore I deſire that men, ſuch as are guilty, may no more hate o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men for that which is our own duties.</p>
            <p>The conſideration of this grievous ſin, ſo abounding, namely, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of them that fear God, cauſeth me to fear, that God that is jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of his Honor, will not ſuffer this ſin to go unpuniſhed.</p>
            <p>I fear that a further ſcourge will paſs through the Land, without timely and ſerious repentance.</p>
            <p>But this I believe, that God will deliver his Church and People.</p>
            <p>About ſixteen or twenty years ago, I remember, that the prophane diſtinguiſhed or differenced thoſe that feared the Lord (thoſe that walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the more circumſpectly, and had reſpect to all Gods Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) from themſelves, under this and the like notions, they called them that feared God, by way of diſdain, <hi>Puritans,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And now I find, that in company, in many places, if a man out of due regard of the truth (and fearing to ſpeak that which may provoke Gods diſpleaſure) do but argue religiouſly concerning the truth of the paſſages of Gods Providences, and perſwade others from ſuch open provocations of God, as ſwearing, whoring, falſe ſpeaking, and like ſins;</p>
            <p>Preſently many are apt to miſchieve him, it is well for him if he ſcape with baſe language, as <hi>Roundhead, Whoreſ-bird, Roundhead, &amp;c.</hi> with bitter hatred; I have lately ſeen this, and heard it to my ſorrow.</p>
            <p>It is ſaid of the wicked, That <hi>they caſt up mire and dirt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This I ſay unto thoſe that fear God, Walk humbly, circumſpectly, mourn for theſe abominations;</p>
            <p>And God will ſpare you, as a man ſpareth his ſon, in the day of cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, when the wicked ſhall be deſtroyed together.</p>
            <p>I pray you, that are more ſober, conſider; you hear ſuch complaints againſt the General, Officers and Army, put theſe complaints in the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:117747:11"/> ballances of Truth, bring them to the Touch-ſtone: You have had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of the behaviour of both parties, on which ſide did ſin (pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſs, plundering, and ſuch acts of prophaneneſs) moſt abound?</p>
            <p>Were the Officers and Souldiers of the Malignant Army more holy, more harmleſs, then this party of this Army?</p>
            <p>For which ſide did God witneſs? or, do you judg, that God ſeeth not, or regards not? &amp;c. Well, ſeek not evaſions; do not reſolve not to ſee, not to conſider, not to acknowledg.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But ſome, I believe, will find fault with me, becauſe I do not name and particularize actions, perſons, times and places more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, with more evident witneſſes, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. My time will not ſuffer me to be ſo large, although I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe (if God will) when I come to points, wherein I purpoſe to engage or inſiſt in thoſe things, I purpoſe to be more punctual.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I anſwer, That men do not uſe candle-light at noon days, when the Sun ſhines bright, but in dark places.</p>
            <p>So are theſe matters, they are not done in corners; theſe matters are accompanied with a cloud of witneſſes.</p>
            <p>Your own experiences, your own conſciences, rightly ballanced, are more then a thouſand witneſſes.</p>
            <p>There are extant in ſome Books, many of theſe particulars, where they are more largely handled; only I hope it will not be grievous, if I put you in minde of thoſe things whereof you have experience al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.</p>
            <p>Moreover thoſe miraculous paſſages of Gods Providence, wherein <hi>(Digitus Dei)</hi> the finger of God evidently appeared, and doth ſtill ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to admiration.</p>
            <p>So that if our hearts be not hardned, and our eyes blinded, (I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive) theſe are witneſſes ſufficient.</p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding, if we ſhut our eyes, if they be not opened, I do conceive, and anſwer as <hi>Abraham</hi> anſwered to <hi>Dives,</hi> being in tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That if one ſhould ariſe from the dead, you would not believe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But let men judg what they pleaſe, this is the comfort and ſtay to them whoſe hearts are right with God, namely this, That God ſeeth, he regardeth, he is a ſtrong God, a wiſe and faithful God, he will make bare his arm, and mightily work for the good of his choſen, and to the confuſion of his enemies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> Courteous Reader, Chriſtian Friend, leſt thou ſhouldſt take
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:117747:12"/> offence, becauſe I kept not more cloſe to the matter propounded:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I ſeeing and conſidering the great bitterneſs, the great heat that evidently appeareth to be in the prejudiced and fore-ſtalled hearts of many men.</p>
            <p>I endeavored only to qualifie that heat, and in part to remove that prejudice, otherwiſe (I conceived that) there would be no place for Peace and Truth to meet together. But to proceed.</p>
            <p>The man that hath moſt effectually written (to my apprehenſion) that yet hath come (to my knowledg) to hinder Peace and Truth at this time from meeting, is Mr <hi>William Prynne,</hi> in his Book called <hi>The ſubſtance of a Speech made in the Houſe of Commons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Touching this man, I have no prejudice againſt him, I never ſaw him, to my knowledg.</p>
            <p>I have likewiſe met with ſome other of his Labors, and upon ſome conſideration of the <hi>matters</hi> in them contained, to my beſt apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, this I finde, That he hath taken much pains, that he is a man en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with divers good gifts (if they be ſanctified:) I do beleeve he is zealouſly affected, and that his <hi>intendments</hi> are for the <hi>glory of God,</hi> and for the good of the <hi>People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I love the man, and do beleeve that we ſhall both <hi>meet before God, and his glorious Angels,</hi> to both our <hi>comforts,</hi> through the rich mercy and free favor of our God, in his dearly beloved Son <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I would not caſt dirt upon all his Labors, but onely I ſhall endeavor to ſift and winnow them, and deſire him to recollect his <hi>thoughts,</hi> and to revive his <hi>Works</hi> over again; and where he findeth an error, I deſire him to recall <hi>that,</hi> and to revoke it.</p>
            <p>Who knoweth the <hi>errors of his life?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In many things we ſin all: This perſwaſion I have of Mr <hi>William Prynne,</hi> That he is ſo <hi>zealous,</hi> and ſo <hi>ingenuous,</hi> that he will not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in a <hi>known error.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Paul</hi> being in an <hi>error,</hi> when he perſecuted Chriſt in his members, brought <hi>much glory to God, great advantage to his Church,</hi> and left himſelf as an <hi>eminent pattern</hi> for others to imitate.</p>
            <p>When, and after he ſaw his <hi>error,</hi> he recanted, and repented, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired his <hi>error.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the firſt <hi>Scripture</hi> alledged, I find this place cited out of <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.9. <hi>Bleſſed are the Peace-makers, for they ſhall be called the children of GOD.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This place, in his <hi>intendments,</hi> pointeth out that which he hoped (as
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:117747:12"/> I beleeve) ſhould be the iſſue of his Labors in the work following.</p>
            <p>But here I finde that of <hi>Solomon</hi> verified:</p>

               <hi>That the race is not always to the ſwift, nor riches to men of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For had this ſpeech of his prevailed, it would have been ſo far from cauſing peace, that I do beleeve both we, and the children yet unborn, ſhould have had cauſe to lament it.</p>
            <p>Had his ſpeech, there declared in that book, prevailed, it would have effected much more <hi>ſorrow and trouble</hi> then before.</p>
            <p>The next <hi>Scripture</hi> is, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.30. <hi>Rebuke the company of ſpear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, ſcatter thou the people that delight in War.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some <hi>Tranſlations</hi> read it thus, <hi>Deſtroy the Company, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Text</hi> here is placed as a leading <hi>exhortation</hi> to the <hi>Reader,</hi> to perſwade them to follow this example.</p>
            <p>This place, compared with that which goeth before, and with that which followeth after, plainly holds out thus much:</p>
            <p>That Mr <hi>Prynne</hi> did endeavor to render the <hi>Army,</hi> root and branch, odious, (for the <hi>Army</hi> conſiſted of the <hi>Head and Members</hi>) which appeareth in the firſt leafe, in the <hi>Title or Inſcription of his Book,</hi> in theſe words; namely,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Armies Remonſtrance, Novemb.</hi> 20. <hi>is a way to ſpeedy and certain ruine, and a meer plot of the Jeſuites to deſtroy us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This he preſents to the whole Kingdom.</p>
            <p>I hope by this time Mr <hi>Prynne</hi> ſeeth cauſe to recall and revoke this: For he inviteth the Kingdom with him to pray, <hi>That God would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the Army,</hi> in the <hi>Scripture</hi> before cited.</p>
            <p>I ſay, with <hi>Steven</hi> the Martyr, <hi>Act.</hi> 7.60. <hi>Lord lay not this ſin to his charge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer, by way of reply to this <hi>Scripture,</hi> That when men do lay <hi>unjuſt ſlanders and reproaches upon others,</hi> and hate them without <hi>juſt cauſe,</hi> it cometh to paſs oft-times that God doth turn <hi>theſe ſlanders and unjuſt reproaches</hi> into <hi>bleſſings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Balak</hi> ſent for <hi>Balaam</hi> to deteſt <hi>Jacob,</hi> and to curſe <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But God turned that <hi>curſe</hi> intended into a <hi>bleſſing, Numb.</hi> 23.8.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>How ſhall I curſe, where God hath not curſed?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Verſ. 24. <hi>Behold, the People ſhall riſe up as a Lion; he ſhall not lie down till he eat of the prey, and till he drink the blood of the ſlain. &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Numb.</hi> 24.5. <hi>How goodly are thy Tents, O Jacob, and thy Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, O Iſrael!</hi> Verſ. 6. <hi>As the valleys are they ſtretched forth, as
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:117747:13"/> the gardens by the rivers ſides, as the Aloe-tree which the Lord hath planted, as the Cedars beſides the waters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Verſ. 9. <hi>Bleſſed be he that bleſſeth thee, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe things I deſire may be well noted and weighed.</p>
            <p>In this matter, firſt, Hath not God, in the ſight of all the world, turned this <hi>imprecation</hi> into a <hi>bleſſing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For God hath been ſo far from deſtroying <hi>that Army,</hi> that, on the contrary, God hath deſtroyed their Enemies, and preſerved them.</p>
            <p>Note, ſecondly, That this <hi>imputation</hi> was unjuſtly layd upon this Army, namely, <hi>that they delighted in War.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For this I do undoubtedly beleeve, That the <hi>Generals,</hi> and <hi>chief of the Army,</hi> and many others, were ſo far from delighting in War, that it was their grief that they could not finde <hi>the way to true Peace</hi> without <hi>War.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God is <hi>the Searcher of all hearts,</hi> and he hath ſhewn, and will ſhew, who thoſe <hi>blood-thirſty men</hi> are, there meant by <hi>David.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, Note, That it is evident (if we conſider the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of Mr <hi>Prynnes ſpeech,</hi> in the <hi>latter part</hi> eſpecially,) that <hi>the Officers of the Army were rendred odious</hi> by Mr <hi>Prynne,</hi> in the face of the <hi>Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> publiquely, in ſo much that he ſaith, <hi>That they ſought the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Common-wealth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This could not be hid from the Army.</p>
            <p>Dearly beloved Country-men, Do by them as you would be dealt withall, had you been in their places, judg righteouſly.</p>
            <p>Conſider that this Army hazarded their lives, and many loſt their Lives amongſt them, of their dear Friends, in defence of the <hi>Parliament and Common-wealth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There was now but a ſtep between <hi>them</hi> and <hi>death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For may not any <hi>rational man</hi> ſee plainly, <hi>That they being,</hi> at the time being, <hi>rendered odious, and Enemies to the Common-wealth,</hi> by Mr <hi>William Prynne,</hi> in a publique way: What wanted then to bring them to deſtruction? Onely this in a <hi>rational way</hi> wanted, <hi>That the King might be made their Head and Governor;</hi> and by that means who is ſo blinde that doth not ſee, that the Kings helpers, in time of his Troubles, ſhould have been exalted, and made their Judges: The Army themſelves were to be disbanded, <hi>that</hi> Mr <hi>Prynne</hi> ſeeketh in his ſpeech to effect; and without controverſie, it had been disbanded, had not God ſhewed the Army the danger, and the ſnare, that they were in:
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:117747:13"/> and withall, if God had not given to the General, and to the Army, an undaunted courage, and if the bleſſing of God had not gone along with them, they had been deſtroyed.</p>
            <p>For, as touching the <hi>Kings party,</hi> of them, of their former mercies (or cruelties rather) the Army had had experience too much, for to truſt them upon ſuch <hi>ſlight pretences.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Conſider now, deal unpartially: would not you, if it were your caſe, rather your enemies, and Gods enemies, and the countries enemies, ſhould periſh, rather then your ſelves and many others?</p>
            <p>Well, had the Army ſate ſtill, till they had been deſtroyed; we might have lamented over their, and our miſeries in <hi>Davids</hi> language, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.33. <hi>Thus dyed Abner as a fool dyeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>erſ.</hi> 34. <hi>Thine hands were not bound, nor thy feet tyed in fetters of Braſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But here I end with this Scripture, hoping that God may one day ſhew M. <hi>Prynn</hi> cauſe to revoke this imprecation.</p>
            <p>In the mean time he may evidently ſee, that it is turned to a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing.</p>
            <p>Concerning M. <hi>Pryns</hi> Speech, I could anſwer to the particulars; but conſidering the ſtraitneſs of preſent time, and likewiſe conſidering, that if I ſhould be long, ſome of his papers might be read of too many. Therefore I obſerve <hi>Davids</hi> counſel in another caſe, who deſiring to cover <hi>Sauls</hi> death, and <hi>Jonathans,</hi> deſired <hi>That it might not be told in Gath, nor publiſhed in the Gates of Askelon, leaſt it cauſed the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Philiſtines to rejoyce.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall therefore endeavor to bind up his anſwer faſt together, his Speech may be divided into two parts, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the firſt, I find many witty and ingenious contrivances, fine twined threds (or to give them a term more ſuitable to his intentions) let them be taken for ſuch cords as the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> uſed to bind <hi>Sampſon</hi> with: Therefore we ſhall let them paſs under this name, M. <hi>Prynns new inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to binde the King, and ſecure the Common-wealth to be in a firm laſting peace, &amp;c. and future felicity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Second part may be conſidered under this notion; M. <hi>Prynns en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to render the Army odious, and enemies to the Common-wealth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I do hope and believe that M. <hi>Prynne</hi> his aims and intendments were real, for to obtain <hi>Peace and Safety.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="24" facs="tcp:117747:14"/>
            <p>But I believe that he was miſtaken, and erred from the pattern ſhew'd in <hi>Gods</hi> revealed will, very far.</p>
            <p>When I looked well upon M. <hi>Prynn</hi> his Speech, with what learning, wit and eloquence it is contrived, conſidering his parts.</p>
            <p>It occaſioned me to remember <hi>Pauls ſpeech,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.27, 28. Thus <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>God hath choſen the fooliſh things of the world, to confound the wiſe, and the weak things of the world, to confound the mighty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Verſ.</hi> 28. <hi>And vile things of the world, and things which are deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and things which are not, hath God choſen to bring to naught things that are.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our bleſſed Saviour ſheweth us a reaſon of this, <hi>Math.</hi> 11.25.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I give thee thanks O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou haſt hid theſe things from the wiſe, and men of underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and haſt opened them to babes.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Verſ.</hi> 26. <hi>It is ſo, O Father, becauſe thy good pleaſure was ſuch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In our times it is not to be much marvelled at, that wiſe men come ſhort, when we conſider of former times, the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were very apt to break, ſleight, and neglect <hi>Gods commandements,</hi> and to prefer their own inventions.</p>
            <p>Was it not ſtrange that they ſhould forſake that <hi>Fountain of living Waters,</hi> that great God <hi>Jehovah,</hi> of whoſe <hi>Faithfulneſs, Wiſedome, Power, Goodneſs, Long-ſuffering,</hi> They had had ſuch large experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of?</p>
            <p>Yet ſearch the Scriptures, and you may ſee many inſtances how they diſtruſted God, how they forſook God, murmured, complained, deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and provoked God, from time to time.</p>
            <p>Was it not to be admired that they ſhould forſake God, and ſet up a golden Calf in <hi>Moſes</hi> his abſence?</p>
            <p>Was it not to be admired, That having had ſuch experience of <hi>Gods Providence and Bleſſing,</hi> under the <hi>Government</hi> of thoſe <hi>Humble, Wiſe, Faithful Judges or Governors,</hi> being ſuch men as entred into their Offices by the immediate and preſcribed will of God, from <hi>Moſes</hi> to <hi>Samuel?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Under which <hi>Governors</hi> they had no cauſe to complain, as by their own confeſſion upon <hi>Samuels</hi> enquiry appeared.</p>
            <p>Yet notwithſtanding, They would and did reject <hi>God their King,</hi> and his <hi>Deputies,</hi> the <hi>Judges,</hi> and they preferred obſtinately Kings of their own invention, in imitation of the <hi>Heathen</hi> round about,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:117747:14"/> and ſo they changed the form of <hi>Government</hi> preſcribed, owned, and bleſſed by God, and ſet up their own inventions, (againſt which, <hi>God</hi> oppoſed) with many circumſtances, arguments, threatenings, and by miracle from heaven.</p>
            <p>Yet they went on obſtinately, they would have a King whatſoever it coſt, what, or how great evils ſoever came thereof.</p>
            <p>And if we conſider, the very root and branch that leadeth M. <hi>Prynn,</hi> and many other wiſe men out of the way, ariſeth from hence. Becauſe they depart from Gods wiſedom revealed in the holy Scrſptures.</p>
            <p>And in the ſtead thereof, prefer their own inventions.</p>
            <p>M. <hi>William Prynn</hi> endeavoreth in the whole ſubſtance of his <hi>Speech,</hi> to bind the King with new ropes, ſuch as the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> bound <hi>Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pſon</hi> with, <hi>and likewiſe with ſeven green cords, and with new ropes never occupied;</hi> and yet more, he plats his locks (as it were) and faſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them with <hi>the thred and pin of the Web and the Woof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But all this to little purpoſe, for I would grant M. <hi>Prynn</hi> ſome part of his argument, which he often rehearſeth, namely, that ſuch contrivan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſuch manacles, were not put upon any (or ſcarcely any) King for a long ſeaſon or from the Creation <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet all to little purpoſe, for bind <hi>Sampſon,</hi> and miſs that way or place wherein his ſtrength reſteth, <hi>and he will break all your Cords a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For in the firſt place it evidently appeareth, That theſe obligations and ties were ſinful, if they could have taken effect.</p>
            <p>Secondly, They were too weak to hold him under, namely the late King.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, They failed in regard they reached not the place where his ſtrength lay.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Theſe matters propounded by M. <hi>Prynn</hi> were not likely to prove to be a means to help the people, but rather to trouble them, and would have brought upon the people, if they had come to effect, many and great evils, and adverſities which the people could no way have ſhun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as I doubt not but that I ſhall make it evidently to appear in the following part of this book, by the help of God.</p>
            <p>Concerning M. <hi>William Prynn;</hi> I look upon him as a man of far more eminent parts then my ſelf: this I ſpeak not out of by-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, but in the preſence of that glorious <hi>God</hi> who I do love and fear.</p>
            <p>I am very fearful to preſume above that which is meet.</p>
            <pb n="26" facs="tcp:117747:15"/>
            <p>Yet this I ſay, That in this matter I believe the Lord hath ſhewed to me his weakneſs.</p>
            <p>I am willingly content to be tryed by the word of <hi>God,</hi> in which try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, I deſire all ſuch as truly love <hi>God,</hi> and his <hi>Truth,</hi> that (without turning to the right or left hand) they will judge uprightly.</p>
            <p>Firſt I conceive, That this M. <hi>Prynne</hi> ſinned in; namely, becauſe that he invented and preſcribed a way to take away from the King divers rights and priviledges which <hi>God</hi> allowed to all lawfull and good Kings, (which all Kings ought to be) and recorded in the Scriptures, the unerring rule of <hi>Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſay it appeareth plainly that this was ſinful, becauſe this way, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by M. <hi>Prynne</hi> in the endeavors of his whole ſpeech, was not a way preſcribed by God, but directly forbidden in the whole tenor of the Scriptures by evident teſtimonies, which ſpeak directly of that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer or authority which <hi>God</hi> gave to Governors and to Kings.</p>
            <p>I doubt not but that will evidently appear, (being duly, and through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tryed) that it is as great an evil to deprive any lawful <hi>Governor,</hi> or <hi>King,</hi> of that authority and power which <hi>God</hi> alloweth to them, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhing it, as it is a ſin and error on the other hand to give to them more power then <hi>God</hi> doth allow them in his Will, revealed in his Word.</p>
            <p>And further it will plainly appear upon due examination, That both theſe are very injurious to the peoples good, comfort, and ſafety; That is to ſay, it will appear that M. <hi>Prynnes</hi> adviſe in deminiſhing that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and authority due to <hi>Governors,</hi> was both a breach of <hi>Gods Law,</hi> and very injurious to the people.</p>
            <p>God ſaith expreſly, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.1, 2. <hi>Hearken O Iſrael, unto the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances and laws which I teach you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>erſ.</hi> 2. <hi>Ye ſhall put nothing to the word which I command you, neither ſhall ye take ought therefrom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We may not do that which ſeemeth good in our own eyes, but all that <hi>God commandeth</hi> us.</p>
            <p>We ſin as well if we turn to the right hand, as if we turn to the left hand, if we add or deminiſh, to, or from Gods commandements.</p>
            <p>Now let us note M. <hi>Prynnes</hi> own expreſſions, which are often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated, words to the ſame effect.</p>
            <p>M. <hi>Prynne</hi> ſaith, fol. 37. <hi>The King hath wholy ſtript himſelf, his heirs and ſucceſſors, for ever, of all that power and intereſt which his
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:117747:15"/> Predeceſſors alwaies injoyed, in the Militia, Forces, Forts, and Navy of England, Ireland, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, In this obſerve, That the King did not this willingly, but by the ſeeking and conſent of M. <hi>Prynne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, To be ſtript wholy for ever of all that power which his Predeceſſors always injoyed, was more then <hi>God</hi> alloweth.</p>
            <p>For obſerve well, this muſt needs follow, That either all the power which the late King, or his Predeceſſors injoyed, was unlawful, (which could not poſſibly be, except they were uſurpers, and entered not into the ſheep-fold aright at the door, &amp;c.) or elſe it is evident that Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> would have taken from the King that power which <hi>God,</hi> and the people gave, yeelded, and did acknowledg to be due to all lawful and good Shepheards or <hi>Governors,</hi> that entered by the door into the Sheep-fold, in all former times.</p>
            <p>This will appear by record of holy Scripture, That <hi>Governors</hi> were allowed by God and the people: <hi>Government</hi> in thoſe matters, of and in which M. <hi>Prynne</hi> preſcribed a way to take from him a power very e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent and conſiderable.</p>
            <p>The Judges of Iſrael never claimed nor exerciſed more power over the people (whether it were in War, or in Peace; whether in thoſe things we diſtinguiſh under names of Spiritual or Temporal matters) then the King did afterwards, for in this matter the Kings took more power.</p>
            <p>Now it is evident, That the Judges took, and the People willingly gave to the Judges, and afterwards to the Kings which ſucceeded, that <hi>Power and Authority</hi> in many caſes; which lawful <hi>Power</hi> M. <hi>Prynne</hi> laboureth to take away, and that in an high degree.</p>
            <p>Now conſider that it doth expreſly appear, if we conſider what power God offered to <hi>Joſhua,</hi> and the people promiſed him; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Joſ.</hi> 1.16. <hi>All that thou commandeſt us, we will do, and whitherſoever thou ſendeſt us, we will go.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Verſ.</hi> 17. <hi>As we obeyed Moſes in all things, ſo will we obey thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, God gave to Kings, and the people gave to Kings, as much power of <hi>Government and command,</hi> as unto the Judges, in lawful things.</p>
            <p>It is evident, That at <hi>Joſhua's</hi> command, the people were armed to the war, and that they were directed by him without asking leave of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inferior Officers, or of the people.</p>
            <pb n="28" facs="tcp:117747:16"/>
            <p>It is evident likewiſe that <hi>David, Saul, Solomon, &amp;c.</hi> did many acts of War and Peace, without any ſuch manacles.</p>
            <p>I would not multiply <hi>Scripture</hi> to prove ſuch <hi>apparent matters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if this be not a ſin, if it be not the direct breach of Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, in a high and great meaſure, for Mr <hi>Prynne</hi> to take from the King his lawful priviledges, my underſtanding faileth me.</p>
            <p>This ſin hath been puniſhed ſeverely, both in the times of the Judges and Kings; let the godly wiſe conſider it.</p>
            <p>Beloved Country-men, it is no <hi>light matter</hi> who we make to be, or receive to be either <hi>King or Governor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We had need to pray to God (to ſearch the <hi>Scriptures</hi>) we had need to enquire of God who ſhall govern us.</p>
            <p>For we muſt give, and yeeld unto <hi>Gods Stewards</hi> (and our <hi>lawful Governors</hi>) ſo much and no leſs power, then God hath afforded to them in the holy <hi>Scriptures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is juſt with God, for the <hi>looſeneſs, wantonneſs, and wickedneſs of people,</hi> when they enquire not of God (when they attend not to the preſcribed Rule of his Word) to know who ſhall guide them, but raſhly, careleſly, and ſlightly follow <hi>their own inventions</hi> about Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors:</p>
            <p>I ſay, It is juſt with God, that <hi>Wolves in ſheeps clothing ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them:</hi> And whereas they might lie down by the <hi>ſtill waters</hi> in peace without fear, if they would take counſel of God who ſhould govern them.</p>
            <p>For the want of this <hi>watchfulneſs,</hi> for want of enquiring of God, and keeping cloſe to thoſe <hi>patterns,</hi> thoſe <hi>rules</hi> appointed by God in his revealed will, the ſacred and unerring <hi>rule of truth</hi> the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> it cometh to paſs that the People err in their choyce and in accepting of thoſe perſons to govern them, that are not men appointed by God.</p>
            <p>Hence it cometh to paſs the People they are moleſted, perſecuted, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured, and reſt in continual fear: and the miſery is, they ſee not the cauſe of their diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>God well knew this, therefore when he would ſhew mercy to <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> his firſt born Son, when no <hi>ſtrange god</hi> was with him, then he took eſpecial care to provide good <hi>Shepherds,</hi> which <hi>Shepherds</hi> he fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with his <hi>bleſſed Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He commanded them to carry the <hi>Sheep of his paſture</hi> in their boſom: <hi>God</hi> bleſſed, directed, ſtrengthened, protected ſuch <hi>Governors</hi> and <hi>Government</hi> of his own deviſing.</p>
            <pb n="29" facs="tcp:117747:16"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Moſes</hi> a man much in favor with <hi>God,</hi> a man enriched with a great meaſure of the <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> did well know, weigh and conſider, of what <hi>great concernment</hi> it was for the <hi>peoples good,</hi> That <hi>God</hi> (and not the <hi>People</hi>) ſhould appoint a man to be <hi>the Shepherd of his people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No doubt he conſidered as much the <hi>Peoples Liberty</hi> as we do, and that the <hi>People</hi> might (unwarrantably) have choſen themſelves a <hi>Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor</hi> after his deceaſe, but he ſaw much of <hi>Gods minde,</hi> and the <hi>Peoples good</hi> reſted in the <hi>choyce of the perſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore <hi>Moſes</hi> knowing that the <hi>people</hi> might err in chuſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a <hi>Leader,</hi> he therefore ſeriouſly and earneſtly deſireth of <hi>God</hi> that he would appoint a man, <hi>Numb.</hi> 27.16. <hi>Let the God of the ſpirits of all fleſh appoint a man over the Congregation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Verſ. 17. <hi>Who may go out and in before them, that the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lord be not as ſheep without a ſhepherd.</hi> Mark how <hi>God</hi> anſwereth them that ſeek for ſafety and direction to him, and truſt not in themſelves.</p>
            <p>Here we may note <hi>two conſiderable matters:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, That <hi>Moſes</hi> looked more at <hi>Gods glory</hi> and the <hi>Peoples good,</hi> then at the preferring his Children to <hi>Government.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A <hi>true Note</hi> of a <hi>true Shepherd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Note, That in the <hi>Government,</hi> that in theſe firſt and pureſt times, (when <hi>Iſrael his ſtrength was as an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nicorn</hi>) then, <hi>when God preſcribed Governors, in Mercy to his firſt born Son, Government went not by ſucceſſion, from Father to Son, in thoſe times,</hi> from <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> to <hi>Samuels</hi> time.</p>
            <p>Indeed afterward, when the <hi>people</hi> would ſlight <hi>God,</hi> and obſtinately caſt <hi>God</hi> off, from being their King, it is conſiderable likewiſe, That <hi>God</hi> removed, then, his gracious preſence farther off from them then before, (though for his own goodneſs ſake he did not wholly depart from them) yet he ſtood at a farther diſtance from them.</p>
            <p>From that time to this, <hi>Government</hi> hath uſually followed by <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral generation,</hi> from Father to the eldeſt Son: (I ſay not that it hath been thus by <hi>Gods Commandment,</hi> for I purpoſe, if <hi>God</hi> will, in time convenient, to ſpeak a word to <hi>that,</hi> to try the caſe.)</p>
            <p>Hence it hath come to paſs, That a <hi>good Father</hi> begetting an <hi>evil Son,</hi> the <hi>People</hi> have been miſerably afflicted.</p>
            <p>O that People would be wiſe to learn by their own experiences!</p>
            <p>Well, let the world do what they pleaſe, I purpoſe (ſeeing <hi>God</hi> hath promiſed to reſtore Judges as at the firſt) that I will not caſt away my
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:117747:17"/> confidence and hope that <hi>God</hi> will perform his Word, and that we may ſee it performed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But why might not the People have choſen themſelves a <hi>Governor,</hi> was there any <hi>great matter</hi> in that?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> The People were ſo well inſtructed in <hi>Joſhua</hi> his time, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his time, the <hi>State</hi> being left vacant of a <hi>principal Guide,</hi> they did not count it to be ſafe for them to chuſe themſelves, therefore they asked counſel of <hi>God,</hi> and attended to <hi>Gods</hi> direction, as appeareth by their actions, <hi>Judges</hi> 1.1. <hi>After that Joſhua was dead, the Children of Iſrael asked the Lord, ſaying, Who ſhall go up for us, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the contrary, look how it fared when the people choſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and by ſucceſſion, recorded <hi>Judges</hi> 9.6. <hi>And all the men of Shechem came and made Abimilech King, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By which choice of the <hi>peoples own invention,</hi> in which they conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not, they enquired not of <hi>God,</hi> who ſhould govern them.</p>
            <p>If we read the place recorded, for our learning, we may ſee what <hi>great afflictions</hi> did befall them; which did evidently ſpring from this root, namely, their miſtaking the man.</p>
            <p>More I purpoſe concerning this <hi>matter</hi> afterwards, if <hi>God</hi> will.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>Saviour</hi> ſaith, <hi>If the firſt fruits be holy, ſo are the branches:</hi> This was the <hi>firſt preſident</hi> (I conceive) revealed, That the Son of a cheif Judg ſucceeded in <hi>Government</hi> next after his Fathers death: and I conceive the people liked this ſo well, that during the time of the Judges till they had forgotten this, and grew wanton (till they rejected <hi>God</hi>) there was not the like example or practiſe.</p>
            <p>This I inſert only as a taſte, and to prepare your minds to conſider of what concernment it is to eye God in chuſing <hi>Governors,</hi> for we may not warrantably deprive <hi>Governors</hi> of thoſe lawful <hi>rights</hi> &amp; <hi>priviledges</hi> granted them by God.</p>
            <p>Neither is it in the power of the People to remove a <hi>King</hi> or <hi>Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor:</hi> I would not be miſtaken here, for where I affirm, that it is not in the power of a People to remove, depoſe, and puniſh a <hi>Governor</hi> in caſe of <hi>Delinquency,</hi> the Reaſon I intend is, Becauſe that ſuch eminent perſons are uſually compaſſed about with ſuch giant-like aſſiſtants, that although it be evident in Scripture, that the People have right in divers caſes to depoſe and to puniſh offenders, yet they dare not, they cannot at their pleaſure; they may poſſibly, by woful experience, come to ſee they are miſtaken in the man, and they may cry out by reaſon of their afflictions, but how to remedy them they cannot tell, for want of power.</p>
            <pb n="31" facs="tcp:117747:17"/>
            <p>Woful experience we have now had of this, whereby we may eaſily diſcern how hard a matter it is to remove a <hi>King</hi> or <hi>Governor,</hi> though never ſo apparently a <hi>Delinquent,</hi> let us be warned, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of God who ſhall govern us, ſo ſhall we be ſure we ſhall not err.</p>
            <p>But to return, we may further obſerve in the ſame leaf, that Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> doth acknowledg, That this way, and theſe preſcriptions, were ſuch as he had no warrant for, neither from the ſacred Scriptures, nor from any other preſident, recorded in humane Records.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fol.</hi> 37. his words are theſe, <hi>None of our Anceſtors ever demanded or enjoyed the like; nor no other Kingdom whatſoever ſince the Creation, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will not contradict his Teſtimony in theſe his expreſſions.</p>
            <p>In this I fully agree, that the ſacred Scriptures, the unerring Rule of Truth, is ſo far from retaining ſuch a preſident, as that the Scriptures Teſtimonies are evident, copious and eminent in the direct oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.</p>
            <p>Conſider what Mr <hi>Prynne</hi> further ſpeaketh in his <hi>Speech, fol.</hi> 39. his words are theſe, <hi>Theſe great Officers and Judges having now no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance at all upon the King, who can neither place nor displace any of them.</hi> And a little further he adds theſe words, <hi>As the King hath entrusted you with &amp;c. ſo hath he entruſted you with his Conſcience, and Courts of Equity too, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was a rare matter for a King, or Supream Judg, to entruſt another man with his <hi>Conſcience,</hi> and more, with his <hi>Courts of Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A little further he addeth, (<hi>fol.</hi> 40.) That <hi>never any Parliament in England claimed or enjoyed ſuch matters as theſe, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I do verily believe a great part of the former.</p>
            <p>I hear ſome uſe very bitter expreſſions againſt new opinions, and againſt ſome that are not ſo indeed.</p>
            <p>But let the godly Reader unpartially conſider, That theſe matters are new Opinions, indeed ſuch as neither Scripture, nor humane Records can produce, by his own confeſſion.</p>
            <p>And further note, That theſe are not new Opinions, about circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial matters, but they do much concern <hi>Gods Glory, Kings, Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, Peoples future ſecurity:</hi> Are not theſe Opinions Capital? If <hi>Errors,</hi> they are great ones.</p>
            <p>I ſhall but touch one Uſe I make of this, and deſire all that are godly
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:117747:18"/> to conſider, namely, That it is good to be humble, meek and lowly; for God ſaith, That he <hi>will teach the humble, and inſtruct the meek.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.17. <hi>That Wiſdom that is from above is firſt pure, then peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, gentle, and eaſie to be entreated.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Verſ. 14. <hi>But if there be bitter envying and ſtrife in our hearts, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce not; for this Wiſdom deſcendeth not from above, but is earthly, ſenſual, and devilliſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Verſ. 18. <hi>The fruits of Righteouſneſs is ſown in Peace, of them that love Peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many in theſe times cry out againſt Opinions, that never knew, nor ſeriouſly examined their own hearts.</p>
            <p>Firſt, It is good to examine our own hearts, where we ſhall eaſily ſee much ignorance, much pride, much evil.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In many things we ſin all,</hi> Jam. 3.2.</p>
            <p>Now this benefit we ſhall have thereby, that we ſhall be the more merciful, in cenſuring others.</p>
            <p>There is a generation aboundeth now, that will be wiſer then thoſe <hi>Governors</hi> that God hath ſet over us:</p>
            <p>And do exclaim againſt our <hi>Governors,</hi> for their remiſſneſs, in that they do not at once root out all <hi>Errors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But conſider, thou that doſt thus, may not thy lot fall amongſt the number of thoſe <hi>Hereticks,</hi> againſt whom thou art ſo fierce?</p>
            <p>Could we wait and perſwade our <hi>Governors,</hi> in meekneſs of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, for Reformation of things amiſs, then we ſhould ſooner prevail, becauſe God would go along with us.</p>
            <p>Mr <hi>Prynne</hi> is very hot, at ſome times, in cenſuring and delivering other mens opinions over to the Sword of the <hi>Chriſtian Magistrate;</hi> I could adviſe him to take heed, that he be not too quick-ſighted, to ſpy, to condemn and perſecute other men for their opinions: I adviſe and counſel him, and my own heart, to be ſlow to wrath, ſlow to cenſure others.</p>
            <p>Let us ſet the ſtaff at our own doors, for we know not how ſoon it may come to our own turn to be in error.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>James</hi> 3. <hi>That wiſdom that is from above, is firſt pure, then peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr <hi>Prynne</hi> was in a great Error, in labouring to take from the King, as a King, any power rightfully due.</p>
            <p>God helped the <hi>Army,</hi> and the remaining part of the <hi>Parliament</hi> (I do believe) to diſcern the way that God had appointed to remedy
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:117747:18"/> thoſe evils in ſuch a way as he himſelf had appointed.</p>
            <p>Conſider we well of two things in this Mr <hi>Prynne</hi>'s Speech.</p>
            <p>Firſt, he ſaith, <hi>That the King ſhould be deprived of all Right and Power in the nomination of Governors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Againſt this the Scripture is directly in oppoſition; for in the firſt and pureſt time <hi>Moſes</hi> had that authority to appoint, or, at the leaſt, to approve of the Officers under or inferior to him: Read and obſerve the place, <hi>Exod.</hi> 18.24.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And Moſes choſe men of courage out of all Iſrael, and made them Heads over the People, and they judged the People at all ſeaſons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>David</hi> he appointed the <hi>Officers of the Army,</hi> as namely, <hi>Joab, the Captain of the Hoſt,</hi> and others; and we may read, That the Kings placed and diſplaced many, put to death and pardoned many.</p>
            <p>I cannot be large in proving ſuch evident matters, I ſhall have occaſion in the Sequel to treat more of theſe matters.</p>
            <p>Such as will have Kings (againſt Gods will) they may here ſee that verified, that <hi>Samuel</hi> ſpeaketh of, namely, That <hi>they ſhall cry out by reaſon of their afflictions, but God will not here them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is many years ſince the days of <hi>Samuel,</hi> and the people have been much corrupted and oppreſſed by evil Kings, which no doubt the people diſcerned plainly, but none durſt, none could help themſelves.</p>
            <p>And had not God ſtirred up theſe worthy men (men that to poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to come ſhall be recorded) for their courage and faithfulneſs, in helping the Lord againſt the mighty, in delivering the people out of that <hi>Egyptian Bondage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Conſider a word, dear Countrymen, under Kings we beſtowed time and coſt to inſtruct our children in the ways of godlineſs.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe the King, then being, ſhould dye, or ſome Idolaters poyſon or make him away, and ſet up his Son, who they ſee is inclining to Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, in his ſtead, what then followeth? <hi>Anſw.</hi> Then all our labour is loſt, or elſe our children ſhall be perſecuted and ſlain, for not forſaking their former <hi>principles;</hi> and this cometh often to be the affliction both of the Father and of the Child.</p>
            <p>Oh that God would open our hearts to be wiſe!</p>
            <p>Well, by my conſent, theſe <hi>Noble Acts of theſe worthies of the Lord ſhall be recorded in Capital Letters, that the Poſterity following may praiſe God for them, that they have been a means to reſtore Judges as at the firſt, and Councellors as at the beginning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I do not dive much into the Laws of man, becauſe as my time will
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:117747:19"/> not ſuffer me, ſo likewiſe my intent is to have recourſe to the Original, the Will of God revealed in the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>For this I doubt not, but that all other Laws are (or ought to be) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from Gods Laws, thoſe being both the Root and Fountain from whence they do ſpring, and alſo the Pattern and Rule to ſquare them by, and to try the Equity of them, their bounds and limits.</p>
            <p>I labour (with the beſt abilities that God doth afford to me) that I may not decline from Gods Laws, either to the right or to the left hand, and that I may neither add nor deminiſh from theſe Rules preſcribed by God.</p>
            <p>I ſee that divers men look ſo much to other Rules and Inventions, that they forget or turn aſide from <hi>Gods Teſtimonies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fol. 39. Touching the other part, M. <hi>Prynne</hi> ſaith, <hi>That the King hath intruſted others with his Conſcience, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I conceive it is one great part of the duty of a ſuperior Judge, to have a chief influence, and an eſpecial part in the determination of the moſt <hi>weighty matters of the State.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore (I do conceive that) where any ſhall depart with this chief part of his work and truſt, and put it wholy out of <hi>his own power,</hi> it may truly be ſaid of them, That <hi>they likewiſe do part with their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence too,</hi> namely, <hi>with their good conſcience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is evident that when <hi>Moſes</hi> (for the eaſe of himſelf, and of the people) did appoint other <hi>Judges or Officers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet, the moſt <hi>weighty</hi> and difficult <hi>caſes,</hi> he <hi>judged</hi> them himſelf, as appeareth in theſe words;</p>
            <p>Exod. 18.26. <hi>But they brought the hard cauſes to Moſes, for they judged all ſmall matters themſelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is clear, That both the judges, and afterwards the Kings, did judg the moſt weighty affaires of the <hi>State.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore (it ſeemeth to me to be evident that) it is ſinful to take that power from <hi>Governors</hi> that God alloweth to them.</p>
            <p>And this (I conceive) is ſo far from ſecuring the Peoples <hi>Peace,</hi> That contrarily it bringeth <hi>heavy burthens,</hi> and <hi>unavoidable inconveniences,</hi> as (God willing) ſhall after be ſhewed. Untempered morter will hardly well, and ſtrongly, cleave together.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now proceed to ſhew, in what reſpects M. <hi>Prynnes</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours were too weak to bind the King, had he been reſtored to his Throne, which is the ſecond Thing propounded.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.2. That <hi>the fear of a King is like to the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:117747:19"/> roaring of a Lion;</hi> That is, it is terrible: and <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.31.</p>
            <p>We may ſee, that even the godly oft-times, out of fear, do conſent to do thoſe things, which they ought not to do.</p>
            <p>When <hi>David</hi> deſired to number the People, his Officers deſired him (ſo far as they durſt) that he would deſiſt from it; 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.4. <hi>Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Kings word prevailed againſt Joab, and againſt the Captains of the Hoſt, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Conſider, I pray you, That in caſe that the late King had been reſtored to his Throne, would not many have ſubjected to his Commands? would not many have ſought his favour? <hi>Solomon</hi> knew that experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally, <hi>Prov.</hi> 29.26. <hi>Many do ſeek the face of the Ruler.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To my apprehenſion, it is very evident, That conſidering how ſtrong a party (for number, perſonable men, fitted with many outward appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, very likely to prevail, and ſo they muſt needs have prevailed, had God been on their ſide,) I ſay, conſidering what great numbers did appear, and attempt with all their ſtrength and skill, to the end that they might have raiſed the King into his Throne by force, againſt the wills (and without the conſent) of the <hi>Parliament,</hi> without the conſent, and againſt the force of the <hi>Army,</hi> and of the <hi>People;</hi> without any <hi>Articles</hi> and <hi>Agreement:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And conſidering further, That theſe Attempts were then made when the King was in adverſity, when he had no authority or means to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence them:</p>
            <p>And conſidering further, That theſe Attempts were made in ſuch a time, as there were ſome armed Forces, in ſome meaſure, ready to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and puniſh them:</p>
            <p>To my apprehenſion, (it is very evident) That had the King ſo far prevailed, to have gained his Throne again, he was likely to have had many more helpes, when he had ſo many advantages more.</p>
            <p>For many of the <hi>Parliament</hi> (it is more then probable) would have taken his party; many of the people that before were afraid to help him, would now have flocked in to ſtrengthen him; many that were fled out of the Land, would have returned; many that would have helped him, for the hope reward: Neighbor Nations, in all probability, would have complyed with him; and many more helps, which now I cannot reckon of up: The Army, his oppoſites, they were to be disbanded.</p>
            <p>Who now would or durſt have ſpoken againſt his <hi>proceedings?</hi> It is more then probable, that in ſhort time the godly muſt have counted that a mercy if they could have fled into a corner; yea, many of thoſe
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:117747:20"/> which then and now were, and are ſo much forward to have reſtored him to his Authority which formerly he had had, even theſe likewiſe ſhould have taſted of the cup of his indignation: who knoweth not the danger of a reconciled enemy, eſpecially againſt whom they had ſo many ways offended, and more eſpecially when he had had power, and they dejected?</p>
            <p>It is likely that the Army, thoſe eſpecially as had been moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and moſt faithful to the <hi>State,</hi> ſhould have drunk deep of the cup of his indignation; but God helped them to ſee, and to prevent this, in which we may ſee (except we will ſhut our eyes) <hi>Digitus Dei,</hi> the very finger of God, againſt all oppoſition: For had they ſate ſtill (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a lawful power in their hands, as I conceive they had, to help them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves) till they had been deſtroyed, we might have lamented over them, <hi>Thus dyed Abner as a fool dyeth: His feet were not made faſt in the ſtocks, neither were his hands bound with fetters of braſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Conſider theſe things, you that fear God, judg righteous judgment; might not our children yet unborn have had juſt cauſe to have bewailed their fathers folly? Do we, or can any man (endowed with reaſon) think (if we will ſpeak, and plainly declare our hearts) that the King would ever have been ſo confined as Mr <hi>Prynnes</hi> Speech importeth? No, doubtleſs theſe bonds were too weak to bind <hi>Sampſon,</hi> becauſe they reached not that place wherein his ſtrength lay.</p>
            <p>Conſider but this, in the next Point, which is the third point pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, namely this, That theſe Propoſitions reached not the ſeat of his ſtrength; the eſſence or being of his ſtrength lay (to my apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion) in theſe two conſiderable places, namely, in his Throne, in his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, that by vertue of that place was belonging to him; his ſtrength lay in his inward affections, there is the ſecond place lay his ſtrength.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, I have ſpoken already, it armed him with ſufficient Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to oppoſe his oppoſers, and to ſuppreſs them.</p>
            <p>And touching the ſecond, namely, his inward affections, this was the next ſecurity to the People; in both theſe Mr <hi>Prynnes</hi> Arguments do fail, and loſe the end propounded, namely, our ſecurity.</p>
            <p>For touching the firſt, his Arguments, they tended to bring the King into his Throne, where had he been ſetled, we ſhould have found, by experience, to our coſt, that Kings are of too great Power to be put into, and kept in ſuch fetters long or often.</p>
            <p>And touching the ſecond, namely, his Heart, of that we have had much experience; for if we look to the fruits, (a ſure rule to diſcern
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:117747:20"/> the heart, where actions are apparent,) there we may plainly ſee, that his heart was carryed away from us to our adverſaries; for proof of this, I deſire that we may look back to his favouring Idolatry and Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters, and prophane perſons, and his ſuppreſſing and diſcountenancing the moſt faithful Miniſters and People.</p>
            <p>Was it not for theſe, and ſuch like matters, that the whole Kingdom in a manner did forſake and oppoſe him at the firſt? And did it not evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appear afterwards, during the War all along, that his helpers, and his Favorites were <hi>Papiſts,</hi> (and I believe many little better then <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſts,</hi>) and moſt prophane perſons, inſomuch that they diſtinguiſhed or differenced themſelves from them that feared God by titles and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, ſuitable to their prophane hearts?</p>
            <p>Have we forgotten the <hi>horrible Blasphemies, damnable ſwearing, prophane curſing,</hi> a note which the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> giveth as a property of Gods enemies? <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.14. <hi>Whoſe mouth is full of curſing and bitterneſs; deſtruction and calamity are in their ways, and the way of peace they have not known, the fear of God is not before their eyes, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Have we forgotten their <hi>whoring, plundering,</hi> their <hi>perfideous dealings,</hi> their <hi>fine deſigns,</hi> their <hi>bloody cruelties?</hi> Beloved Friends, theſe ſins were not committed in corners, in ſecret, but in the ſight of the Sun.</p>
            <p>And were not many or moſt of their <hi>principal Leaders,</hi> leading men to give them patterns in ſinning?</p>
            <p>I would adviſe our <hi>Royaliſts</hi> now to take heed what they do, for it is very evident, that to this day a great part (to ſpeak with as much moderation as I may) of thoſe that are ſo bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly againſt the <hi>Army</hi> and <hi>Parliament,</hi> declare too evidently, That there is too little fear of God before their eyes, but much blaſphemous ſwearing, much curſing, much hatred againſt them that fear God.</p>
            <p>I am a witneſs of this to my ſorrow.</p>
            <p>They, that <hi>party,</hi> that cry out moſt eſpecially againſt the <hi>diverſity of Opinions,</hi> but in the mean time many of them agree in one <hi>joynt Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> (witneſs <hi>their fruits</hi>) namely this, <hi>That they will caſt off Gods yoke, his Commandments;</hi> They will be ſo far from doing the good will of God, that they hate him that they perceive hath reſpect to Gods Laws.</p>
            <p>I hope there are many that fear God, that through weakneſs ſeem to
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:117747:21"/> ſide with <hi>that party,</hi> but let them beware, for if <hi>that party</hi> could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, they ſhould finde a <hi>ſtrong party</hi> againſt themſelves.</p>
            <p>Well, if I ſhould be ſilent, and the ſtones they tread on ſhould hold their peace, yet the moſt high <hi>God</hi> ſeeth theſe things, who is a <hi>God</hi> jealous of his honor, and will not hold ſuch wicked guiltleſs.</p>
            <p>Dear Friends, (I call <hi>God</hi> to record) That with grief I rehearſe <hi>theſe matters,</hi> neither do I do it out of hatred to <hi>that party,</hi> but aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at <hi>Gods glory,</hi> their <hi>true good and converſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Conſider, dear Friends, Do not <hi>thoſe intelligences and correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences,</hi> which the King held all along with <hi>Papiſts, Idolaters,</hi> with <hi>thoſe bloody Murtherers</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> (who filled their ſhoes with the blood of ſo many thouſands in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and that in a <hi>time of Peace,</hi> as if it had been in a <hi>time of War;</hi>) Do not <hi>theſe</hi> declare, That <hi>the late King his heart was not right with the Lord?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Can any man ſhut his eyes ſo cloſe to hide <hi>theſe things from his ſight?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Note further what the King granted, and Mr <hi>Prynne</hi> layeth down as a <hi>ſure foundation</hi> to build a <hi>ſort</hi> upon againſt the revival of <hi>Biſhops;</hi> In his <hi>Speech</hi> he ſaith, <hi>That the King conſents to put down corrupt Biſhops, and their appurtenances, &amp;c.</hi> but with this clauſe, <hi>That he will ſtill allow of Apoſtolical Biſhops:</hi> He ſaith, <hi>The King contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for no other now, but their power of Ordination onely.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Who is ſo blinde, now, that doth not ſee the <hi>Kings heart</hi> in this low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt time of his dejection?</p>
            <p>Now for us to hope, That our power ſhall prevail more then the King his power, in caſe he had been again received as a King, (I do conceive) our hope ſhould have been built upon the ſand.</p>
            <p>Conſider we further, That ſuppoſe that the <hi>Kings heart</hi> was moſt cordial for the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> (of which there was juſt cauſe of <hi>ſuspition,</hi> if we conſider of all <hi>the premiſſes</hi> together) then we may eaſily gather, <hi>That a Dispenſation from the Pope would take away all theſe bonds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, let us but conſider, That in caſe the <hi>late King</hi> had been reſtored, if his <hi>heart</hi> had not been firm, he ſhould not have wanted enough men that would have perſwaded him, that <hi>theſe ties or cords,</hi> with which he was bound, were forced upon him in his afflictions, and that <hi>God</hi> had afforded to Kings <hi>other</hi> and more <hi>power:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that it ſhould be a ſin in him not to break ſuch unlawful <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants</hi> forced upon him.</p>
            <pb n="39" facs="tcp:117747:21"/>
            <p>And like it is, That the King would have readily conſented.</p>
            <p>Then ſhould they that had been actors in making thoſe acts, been accounted vilde, and ſinners, and no doubt but that they ſhould quickly have taſted of the <hi>cup of his displeaſure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Laſtly, Conſider, That in caſe that <hi>theſe obligations</hi> could have prevailed, yet what <hi>comfort or benefit</hi> ſhould the <hi>Common-wealth</hi> have received thereby?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. We ſhould have had <hi>the maintenance</hi> of a <hi>titulary King,</hi> and his Company, to have provided for.</p>
            <p>Secondly, We ſhould have had <hi>continual emulation and jealouſies</hi> between the <hi>King and the Subject, or Parliament,</hi> who muſt have kept ſome armed Force for <hi>their defence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For, can we conceive, That the King and his Favorers would ever have taken it well and quietly, to have been thus deprived of <hi>thoſe things</hi> that they would have conceived to have belonged to all his <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors</hi> always, and that no Record from the <hi>Creation</hi> (neither divine nor humane) could give a <hi>preſident</hi> for?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Do we think this would have brooked, if the <hi>Parliament</hi> muſt (in a full Body, conſiſting of Lords and Commons) have given <hi>their direction</hi> and <hi>conſent</hi> to ſo many <hi>State-matters,</hi> from time to time?</p>
            <p>Then (it ſeemeth to me that) it would have unavoydably followed, <hi>That the Parliament must have ſitten continually, or at the leaſt ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry often.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From which (or upon which) I do not ſee but that the <hi>Parliament-men</hi> would have been ſo wearied, that they would have ſought to have relinquiſh'd this.</p>
            <p>And (I do conceive) that the <hi>People</hi> would by this means have been diſtracted, divided, and moleſted with <hi>Taxations</hi> to bear this <hi>great charge,</hi> beſides many <hi>other grievances</hi> I forbear.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, To ſum up all Mr <hi>Prynnes</hi> Endeavors together, they hold out thus much.</p>
            <p>Firſt, He laboreth <hi>to exalt him to the Throne,</hi> to <hi>that honor</hi> to be our <hi>Shepherd,</hi> our <hi>Governor;</hi> a man, who (I beleeve) <hi>God</hi> had appointed to <hi>death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, He ſeeketh <hi>the ſetting up, and the continuance of a Kingly Government,</hi> which (I beleeve) <hi>God</hi> hath numbred and finiſhed.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, He ſeeketh <hi>to deſtroy, or to weaken thoſe which were</hi> (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentally) <hi>our best friends.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="40" facs="tcp:117747:22"/>
            <p>Fourthly, He held it <hi>ſafer for the Common-wealth, and more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous, for to have the conſtant Government of the Common-wealth to be determined by ſuch a great number of Parliament-men, rather then by one as chief, and other Officers, as Judges, diſtributed unto their ſeveral Charges:</hi> but how far this would have been from the <hi>pattern of the will of God</hi> revealed in the <hi>Scripture;</hi> and how far this would have burthened the <hi>people,</hi> and put them from <hi>their peace and comfort,</hi> I purpoſe, if God will, to ſhew afterwards, in the place thereof, more at large.</p>
            <p>All theſe ariſe from this root, <hi>He ſeeth the Common-wealth to be troubled, and out of order;</hi> and (I beleeve) he labored painfully to cure and remedy <hi>thoſe troubles:</hi> But God hid from his eyes what was <hi>the true cauſe,</hi> and thence proceeded his miſtakes in the remedy.</p>
            <p>Conſider onely this task, When <hi>Moſes</hi> ſate, and the whole <hi>People</hi> came about him, from morning to night, it was <hi>too great a burthen</hi> both to him and them: But in caſe many <hi>Moſes's,</hi> many Judges, had been appointed to ſit, and determine every caſe of the <hi>peoples,</hi> then Cauſes muſt needs have been longer in the iſſuing them, and both the Judges and the People ſhould have been more burthened; but I forbear in this place.</p>
            <p>It is obſervable, <hi>That a diſeaſe truly and evidently known, it is in a ready and probable way to be cured with more eaſe, more ſpeed, leſs danger, and leſs coſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the contrary, Phyſicians miſtaking the diſeaſe, oft-times admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter ſuch potions, as do more hurt, and do more endanger; So it is in this <hi>matter,</hi> the diſtemper is miſtaken.</p>
            <p>My advice therfore is this, <hi>That we follow the wiſdom of God, revealed in the ſacred Scriptures, without turning to the right, or to the left hand:</hi> For, I beleeve, if we do follow our own <hi>inventions</hi> in <hi>theſe weighty matters, Peace</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> will hardly meet together.</p>
            <p>If God help us to agree in <hi>this weighty point,</hi> namely, <hi>That our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors be ſuch true Shepherds as come in at the true door of Gods re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed will, contained in the holy Scriptures;</hi> Then we need not to doubt but that ſuch will love the ſheep, and upon ſuch God will beſtow his bleſſed Spirit upon them, to guide them: Such God will own, and the People will finde the benefit by them, and will hear their voyce.</p>
            <p>We are not left without hope, for God hath promiſed <hi>to reſtore Judges as the firſt, and Counſellors as at the beginning; then ſhall we be called a City of Righteouſneſs, Iſai.</hi> 1.26. And by this means
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:117747:22"/> we ſhall again acknowledg the great happineſs that it is to have God to raign over us.</p>
            <p>Now let us conſider the other part of Mr <hi>Prynne</hi> his <hi>Speech</hi> and <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors,</hi> which was to render the <hi>Army</hi> as <hi>enemies to the peace and ſafety of the Common-wealth,</hi> as appeareth in the firſt leaf in the <hi>ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription,</hi> or in <hi>the Directory to the Reader,</hi> that he might thereby point out to the <hi>Reader</hi> what he intended in the following <hi>Treatiſe,</hi> or matter of his <hi>Writings,</hi> the words are theſe, <hi>viz. The Armies Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance,</hi> Novemb. 20. <hi>is a way to ſpeedy and certain Ruine, and a meer Plot of Jeſuites to deſtroy us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This (if we read and conſider the ſubſtance of Mr <hi>Prynne</hi> in his <hi>Speech</hi>) will evidently appear, that he labours to render the <hi>Army</hi> as <hi>enemies to the Common-wealth,</hi> as thoſe that ſought to bring another <hi>War,</hi> and more <hi>bloodſheding,</hi> as thoſe that were <hi>favorites</hi> to, and <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plotters</hi> with <hi>Papiſts, Jeſuites,</hi> as thoſe that ſought the <hi>destruction of the Kingdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us now conſider, whether this <hi>Charge</hi> were true or no; and firſt let us begin at the Root, after conſider the fruit that groweth upon the Branches.</p>
            <p>Mr <hi>Prynne</hi> maketh this the Root or Ground, <hi>That the Army la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to bring the late King to a juſt Tryal for the breach of Gods Laws, who is the King of Kings;</hi> he ſaith, <hi>That this was plotted by Jeſuites, to the end they might hinder the re-eſtabliſhing the late King in his Throne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now (when it is uprightly conſidered of) I believe it will appear di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to be contrary to his <hi>Propoſitions,</hi> even as light is contrary to darkneſs, which appeareth, if we conſider theſe two matters:</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That the Officers held no correspondency with Jeſuites, ſo known to be, nor did they favour the Jeſuites ſo much as other men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That if there had been many Ieſuites in the Army diſguiſed, yet it had been directly contrary to their Principles, to their Prosperity, to depoſe thoſe Members of Parliament ſecluded or restrained; and likewiſe it was more contrary to the Religion and intentions of Ieſuites, to bring the King to a lawful Tryal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, Touching the firſt, It is evident (in my apprehenſion) <hi>that the Army,</hi> I mean, the principal Leaders of the Army, <hi>held no corresponden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy with the Ieſuites;</hi> firſt, becauſe their <hi>Tenents,</hi> their <hi>Religion,</hi> and their <hi>Practice</hi> was directly in oppoſition to the <hi>Ieſuites:</hi> For if we conſider this, that the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> maintain the Worſhip of Idols, and they,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:117747:23"/> the <hi>Ieſuites,</hi> teach and maintain, That <hi>Ignorance is the Mother of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion,</hi> and to further that, they will not ſuffer the Lay-people to read the <hi>Scriptures</hi> in their own language; the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> will not ſuffer the Lay-people to diſpute <hi>religious matters,</hi> much leſs to ſpeak to an <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of People</hi> by way of <hi>Prophecy,</hi> and many other like matters, too tedious to rehearſe.</p>
            <p>Now if we do conſider unpartially, the Army, both in their profeſſion and practice, are directly oppoſite to theſe matters: And that the Army held no correſpondency with the <hi>Ieſuites,</hi> appeareth in this, becauſe in all this War they uſed the utmoſt of their endeavors to pull down, or deſtroy, or captivate that party. Indeed it is conſiderable, that the Kings party were a great party of either <hi>Ieſuites,</hi> or thoſe that highly eſteemed <hi>Ieſuites,</hi> and by Letters and writing, diſcovered and intercept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it too evidently appeared, that they held correſpondency with them; but I never heard (that I remember) that the Officers of the Army were tainted with that infection, nor that any Writing was diſcovered, or other act done by them, that might lead us to have ſuch hard thoughts of them.</p>
            <p>And ſince that time we may take notice, That thoſe Miniſters that they appoint, or thoſe that they favour, are ſuch men that do teach ſound doctrine, we cannot deny it: And likewiſe, let any <hi>Ieſuite</hi> be produced, that they have preferred to the Miniſtry to this day, if there be any ſuch (as I believe there are none) they came in, and remain, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed, ſo that the Army doth not know them to be ſuch.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Let us conſider this, <hi>That it was contrary to that which the Jeſuites and Romiſh party all along labored after, for the Jeſuites to deſire that the King ſhould be tryed, much loſs that he ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from the Throne of Government;</hi> which appeareth plainly (if we will not be wilfully blind) in as much as the <hi>Romiſh Catholiques</hi> were chiefeſt men to help the King to get into his Throne, upon his own terms; They were the <hi>chiefeſt Enemies</hi> to thoſe that feared God, ſuch as they termed <hi>Roundheads,</hi> which were of the <hi>Armies</hi> ſide.</p>
            <p>If the King had been reſtored to the <hi>Throne of Government,</hi> it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent that the <hi>Romiſh party</hi> ſhould have had much more <hi>advantage</hi> by <hi>that,</hi> then in caſe the <hi>Army</hi> prevailed to do Juſtice upon him.</p>
            <p>I would not ſpend too much time to light a Candle at Noon-day: <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.11. <hi>If any will be filthy, let him be ſo ſtill;</hi> he ſhall ſhortly have his reward.</p>
            <p>Now let us briefly conſider of the fruits and ſucceſs of the <hi>Armies
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:117747:23"/> proceedings</hi> ſince the <hi>late Kings death,</hi> becauſe Mr <hi>Prynne</hi> prophecyed in exceeding large terms, <hi>That the bringing the King to condign and worthy puniſhment, for his breach of the Laws of the moſt high God, with whom is no respect of perſons, This would bring upon us</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>a ſpeedy and certain ruine, and more preſent and great Wars, and effuſion of blood amongst our ſelves:</hi> This is the very ſubſtance of his Prophecy, to my apprehenſion.</p>
            <p>Let us now judg <hi>true and righteous judgment,</hi> as in the preſence of the moſt high, and glorious, and bleſſed God.</p>
            <p>Is not the direct contrary of this Prophecy, in a <hi>great meaſure,</hi> ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, and come to paſs, which diſcovereth that this was no true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy? This will evidently appeare, if we conſider, <hi>That in the very time of the Kings death, God ſo wonderfully ordered it, that not one man loſt his life</hi> (that I heard of) <hi>by any way, in ſtanding up to reſcue the late King, although it was not acted in a corner:</hi> This is a <hi>matter</hi> not to be paſſed without due <hi>conſideration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And from that time God did ſo wonderfully turn about the wheel of his Providence, That we have had <hi>peace and quietneſs,</hi> in a <hi>great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,</hi> both by Sea and Land, to this very day, in this <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> notwithſtanding that <hi>the contrary party</hi> were numerous and bitter.</p>
            <p>Can we poſſibly reply againſt this, wherein the very finger of God hath appeared, to the <hi>aſtoniſhment of Gods Enemies?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I do beleeve indeed, That ſome being led away with thoſe apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, <hi>That it ſhould have been well pleaſing to God that the King</hi> (though guilty of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> though guilty of much <hi>former profaneneſs,</hi> of much blood-ſhed in other places before this War begun; Though guilty in putting (or ſuffering, or cauſing many <hi>innocent perſons</hi> to be put) to death, both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and guilty of letting the wicked go free, and exalting them; Though guilty of the blood of ſo many thouſand of <hi>Engliſh-men:</hi> Though guilty of the capital break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Gods Laws,</hi> in not puniſhing and ſuppreſſing thoſe horrible and openly known <hi>Blasphemers, Robbers, Adulterers, Whoremongers,</hi> and what not ſins were committed openly (not in darkneſs, but in the ſight of the Sun, in a continued way of wickedneſs?) Of which ſins, ſo committed, with an high hand, it was not poſſible but that he muſt be guilty of them; Though guilty of many more ſins, not here to be reckoned up:) I ſay, ſome have been led away through infirmitie, ſo <hi>that they thought that it would have been well pleaſing to God that the late King ſhould have been clad in Royal Apparel, and have waſhed
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:117747:24"/> out theſe ſpots, and been again exalted into his former Throne, and been made the Head, Guide, and Governor of ſo many thouſands:</hi> I ſay, That for thoſe that have been ſo miſled through infirmities, I pray God give them <hi>ſound and timely repentance, and lay not this ſin to their charge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is well to be noted, That when <hi>David</hi> cauſed that one innocent man <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi> to be put to death by ſubtlety, 1 <hi>King.</hi> Chap. 11, 12. <hi>David</hi> gave <hi>ſentence,</hi> that ſuch a perſon ſhould dye, and make <hi>reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> The <hi>Prophet</hi> tells him he was the man condemned.</p>
            <p>Obſerve well, That <hi>David</hi> lay under this <hi>ſentence</hi> till the moſt high God himſelf proclaimed a pardon to his perſon at <hi>that time;</hi> yet ſo, as that <hi>David</hi> ſhould feel the <hi>breach of Gods Law;</hi> although it is to be conſidered, That <hi>David</hi> had been an <hi>eminent man</hi> for <hi>Gods honor</hi> many years before.</p>
            <p>Let us further conſider, <hi>That God hath, ſince the late Kings death, ſhewed his approbation;</hi> which hath appeared, if we conſider, <hi>That before the late Kings death, as we had many Riſings, which occaſioned much trouble, danger, and blood-ſhed; ſo likewiſe, God frowned upon us in ſmiting the fruits of the earth, ſo that Corn, and moſt other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, failed, and were very dear:</hi> Whereby God did (to my appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion) ſhew, <hi>That he was displeaſed that the People, or thoſe in whoſe hands it lay, were ſo ſlow in proceeding to puniſh ſo great an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But we may take notice, <hi>That ſince the late Kings death God hath turned his favorable countenance towards us wonderfully,</hi> as appeared by <hi>the Harveſt of Corn;</hi> for they had ſeaſonable <hi>weather</hi> to reap and to lay up their Corn in <hi>ſafety;</hi> and I hear the people in <hi>Cornwal</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vonſhire</hi> report, <hi>That their Corn yeelded more encreaſe in the threſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, then former years, abundantly; in ſo much that one ſheaf yeelded more Corn then two did in ſome former years:</hi> Our Fiſhing and Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding hath proſpered.</p>
            <p>Moreover, God hath gone forth with our <hi>hoſt,</hi> with our <hi>Army,</hi> ſo that which way ſoever they turn themſelves, God maketh them to proſper, and victoriouſly to prevail; The very finger of <hi>God</hi> appeareth: I am aſhamed, and even aſtoniſhed, to finde any that ſhould object againſt this; yet I find too many that will not ſee, nor acknowledg, theſe won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful works of a glorious and righteous <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> Some ſay, <hi>That the wicked may prosper for a time: Did not</hi> Nebuchadnezzar <hi>prosper? and did not</hi> Joab <hi>prosper? &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="45" facs="tcp:117747:24"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> There is no reaſonable proportion in theſe <hi>Arguments;</hi> for I do evidently ſee, That their Objections, in this kinde, ariſe from this root, namely, <hi>becauſe they are partial, and unwilling that God ſhould favor the now being Government and Army;</hi> for whom I do beleeve that, in the concluſion, both we, and the poſterity to come, ſhall have cauſe to praiſe the name of the Lord for them.</p>
            <p>Theſe Objections ariſe not out of well ballanced <hi>meditations,</hi> for compare we <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> and other their victories againſt the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites,</hi> and we may read, That ſometimes <hi>God</hi> ſuffered the Enemies to prevail againſt <hi>Iſrael;</hi> but how was that? it was by bringing a <hi>multitude of Enemies</hi> againſt a <hi>few Iſraelites</hi> in compariſon: But that ſuch ſmall numbers, ſuch weak men, upon ſuch unequal terms of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage, ſhould prevail againſt ſuch great numbers of able men (in outward appearance, ſo well furniſhed and armed, with ſo <hi>great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages and encouragements,</hi> as in outward appearance) the Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites and Enemies of our <hi>preſent Army and Government</hi> had, I do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve the like is not recorded, either in <hi>the ſacred Scriptures,</hi> or in any <hi>humane Records. God driveth their Enemies before them, as chaff before the wind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is true, That if contrarily we look upon <hi>this Army and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> as thoſe that love and fear the Lord, then we ſometimes, in <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> finde <hi>God</hi> doing wonderful and miraculous <hi>matters,</hi> exceeding theſe Victories, but not uſually, for theſe are <hi>tranſcendent Victories.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if we ſhould look upon <hi>the Parliament and Army</hi> as upon <hi>Gods Enemies,</hi> I doubt not but I may ſafely affirm, That there is no Record, neither divine nor humane, that ſheweth that God did ever do ſuch wonders, give ſuch victories, upon ſuch unequal <hi>terms of diſadvantage,</hi> to the <hi>Enemies of his Church and People;</hi> ſo many, and in ſo ſhort a ſpace of time, as <hi>theſe</hi> have been effected: The Lord open the eyes of all thoſe that love and fear him.</p>
            <p>Conſider further, That in all <hi>theſe proceedings</hi> we may note, That our worthy (and dearly beloved) <hi>Generals</hi> have not aſpired to any place of <hi>Government</hi> further then they have been evidently called: in all <hi>theſe Wars</hi> they have endured many perils, much affliction, much hardſhip; and when God giveth to them victories, they lay down their Conqueſts, and give thoſe places into the hands of the <hi>State.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Conſider that we may read of men, that had not ſuch opportunities, as they have had, that have attempted and obtained Crowns and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms to themſelves by violence.</p>
            <pb n="46" facs="tcp:117747:25"/>
            <p>Conſider further, That in thoſe <hi>Propoſitions</hi> that the <hi>Army, their Officers,</hi> propounded to the <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> to ſettle a <hi>Government,</hi> by men ſelected, through the Land, did they name themſelves to be choſen into great places? No certainly; They put it further off, into the hands of others, who in after-times muſt have been <hi>their Judges?</hi> And further, The choyce of thoſe they committed to others that were ſtrangers to them: Whereby it plainly appeareth, That (according to <hi>that meaſure of Light</hi> (in <hi>that matter</hi>) that God imparted to them) they ſought Gods glory, and the good of the <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> and not themſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> There are many other Objections very impertinent or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderate, as namely, <hi>That this State now ſuffereth many evil Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Practices.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I could deſire every man to take heed firſt to his own ways, for it is the practice of too many, to be careleſs in examining themſelves, and forget, not altogether, that many now leap over the offences of the contrary party, and bury them in ſilence, or call evil good.</p>
            <p>I do not doubt, but that the <hi>Government</hi> doth labour to ſuppreſs all known ſin, and I believe that as God giveth to them time and oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, we ſhall ſee it appear by their fruits, which God grant.</p>
            <p>Something more I judg my ſelf in duty bound to write, touching that Book entituled, <hi>The Sword of Christian Magistracy Supported,</hi> written by Mr <hi>William Prynne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From the general conſideration of the whole matter, as it is there written; and the manner thereof: Conſidering likewiſe what pains he hath taken in the alledging and ſearching ſo many Records of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane <hi>Authors,</hi> of <hi>Emperors, Kings, States, Magiſtrates, the Conſent of Ancient and Modern Writers, the Statute Laws of England:</hi> Conſidering likewiſe the great pains, time and charge he ſpent about the other his Labours, namely, that <hi>Speech</hi> of his to the <hi>Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi> dated the 4 of <hi>Decemb.</hi> 1648.</p>
            <p>Upon the conſideration of the whole, it cauſeth me to conſider, how we are oftentimes miſtaken, when we too earneſtly, and with much care and induſtry, endeavor to <hi>attain matters,</hi> which could we accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh, (thoſe things that we ſo affectionately labour after, which often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times we fall ſhort of,) yet they would but little avail us, and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times turn to our great diſadvantage.</p>
            <p>We often travel in thoſe ways that are a great way about, when we might go a nearer and ſafer way, and attain the end of our journey with more eaſe and ſafety.</p>
            <pb n="47" facs="tcp:117747:25"/>
            <p>I do not judg, That it is unlawful to cite the <hi>Testimonies</hi> of other <hi>Records,</hi> beſides the <hi>Teſtimony of the Word of God,</hi> but to ſpend much labour or time in the allegation of other <hi>Teſtimonies</hi> beſides the <hi>Word of God</hi> contained in the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> the unerring <hi>Rule of Truth,</hi> I do conceive it ads but little ſtrength to the cauſe, if it be a matter that bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the conſcience in holy duties: For when we alledg the <hi>Word of God,</hi> delivered by the <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> (men immediately ſent by God) this cometh with the Authority (and hath the Majeſty) of God ſtamped upon it; this cometh with power, it ſearcheth, tryeth and convinceth the heart, and inward affections, it is like a two-edged-ſword, it pierceth ſpeedily unreſiſtibly: The Writings of men are not uſeleſs, but being compared with the <hi>Word of God,</hi> they then are but as a candle compared with the Sun. Now for men that would walk by the benefit of the light, (and deſire that others ſhould walk by the ſame light) for ſuch men to ſpend ſo much pains, to light many candles to ſhew the way, (then at noon-day, when the Sun ſhineth in his ſtrength) is not to ſo much purpoſe.</p>
            <p>The Word of God cometh thus, namely, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But when men alledg the Teſtimonies of other Writers, they muſt come clad in this habit (namely) <hi>He ſaith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. It often cometh to paſs, That when we are ſo intent, ſo ſtudious, and ſpend ſo much time in searching, examining, and alledging ſo many other Authors, (beſides Gods unerring Word) it often cometh to paſs, that we are too ſhort in our allegations of the Word of God it ſelf, the lively and clear Fountain of Living Waters.</p>
            <p n="3">3. By this means of looking too much upon humane <hi>authorities,</hi> and neglecting (or too little taking heed) to the Word it ſelf, it cometh to paſs oft-times, that humane <hi>Authors,</hi> varying in their judgments, lead us aſide into thoſe Errors that they hold.</p>
            <p n="4">4. From this Root it cometh to paſs, that the Servants of God are too much ſlighted and deſpiſed, for they being converſant, and ſtudious chiefly of the Word of God, they are but meanly reſpected, becauſe they come adorned and decked chiefly with plainneſs and ſimplicity: <hi>Paul</hi> cometh thus apparelled, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.4. <hi>Neither ſtood my words, and my preaching in the intiſing words of mans wiſdom, but in plain evidence and power.</hi> Was not this the cauſe that Chriſt Jeſus was ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed? Was not this the cauſe that his Apoſtles and Diſciples were deſpiſed? Read 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.11, <hi>&amp;</hi> 13. <hi>Which things alſo we teach or ſpeak, not in the words which mans wiſdom teacheth, but which the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt teacheth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:117747:26"/>5. Oft-times this (being adorned or apparelled ſo much with the authorities of ſo many other Writings beſides the Word) lifts us up in our affections, to preſume more then is meet, and cauſeth us to deſpiſe many of Gods Saints, and little ones, that are not thus apparelled with ſo many humane <hi>authorities:</hi> And (I believe) it too evidently appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that from this very Root is ſprung up ſuch a flame of fire, that will with much difficulty be quenched: God grant it may be quenched.</p>
            <p n="6">6. My Endeavors are primarily the glory of God, and <hi>that Peace and Truth may meet and kiſs one another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To all thoſe that earneſtly and heartily deſire and endeavor the ſame, namely, <hi>Gods Glory, Peace and Truth,</hi> I doubt not but that I may ſafely and boldly ſay, That if they deck themſelves inwardly with lowlineſs of mind, let them be but low enough in their own eyes, (let them but learn of Jeſus Chriſt to be humble and meek, a leſſon much urged by <hi>Moſes,</hi> the <hi>Prophets, Chriſt,</hi> and his <hi>Apostles,</hi> and yet how little do we profit?) and I doubt not but Gods Name will be much honored, many of our brethren will be much edified, the weak much ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, our ſelves much more approved in the hearts of others, and the flame of the fire of hatred and contention will be much abated, and thereby we ſhall poſſeſs our own Souls with more peace, and Peace and Truth will meet and embrace one another ſooner.</p>
            <p>Dear Countrymen, and Chriſtian Friends, <hi>Be not many Maſters, knowing that we ſhall receive the greater condemnation,</hi> Jam. 3.1. As if the Apoſtle ſhould ſay, Conſider, that by theſe contentions we ſhall receive no profit, but much loſs.</p>
            <p>Now conſider, whence come our contentions? come they not through pride? Yea certainly they do, witneſs the <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles;</hi> conſider, That <hi>God reſiſteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble and meek,</hi> Jam. 4.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>God will teach the humble his ways,</hi> Pſal. 2.</p>
            <p>Oh Brethren, Countrymen and Friends, That I could prevail with you in this particular, <hi>That you would forbear one another, and inſtruct one another, and build up, and edifie one another in love; Let every man eſteem other better than himſelf: Let there be no root of bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs amongst us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Pſal. <hi>Wait upon God patiently, and he ſhall bring it to paſs; thine eyes ſhall ſee it, and thy heart ſhall be glad.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this I doubt not, but that I may ſafely affirm by the ſacred Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Gods revealed Will in his Word, That if ever thou ſhalt meet
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:117747:26"/> Chriſt Jeſus as thy Husband, in his Kingdom, to thy comfort, thou muſt come to him <hi>as a Bride prepared for her Huſband,</hi> (in which <hi>preparation</hi> this is a <hi>principal part</hi>) namely, <hi>to be inwardly adorned, inriched, and furniſhed with lowlineſs, with humility.</hi> Pretend what <hi>faith in Chriſt</hi> thou wilt, or canſt, whoſoever thou art, if thou haſt not <hi>this grace</hi> in ſome good meaſure, thou ſhalt never meet <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> to thy comfort.</p>
            <p>Excuſe me, dear friends, if I digreſs, or be large (though not large enough) in <hi>this matter;</hi> for this is a <hi>principal preparation</hi> to the way where <hi>Peace and Truth</hi> dwelleth: Time bids me forbear.</p>
            <p>To return to the <hi>matter</hi> of Mr <hi>Prynnes</hi> Book: in the Book entituled, <hi>The Sword of Chriſtian Magiſtracy ſupported,</hi> I finde therein many precious <hi>ſentences</hi> alledged, or taken from of the Word of God, out of the Word of God, being the very <hi>authority,</hi> the very <hi>writings</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtles and Prophets:</hi> Theſe <hi>Scriptures</hi> come to me with <hi>authority;</hi> I conſent unto them, whether they were written (before the Coming of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> in the Fleſh) by the <hi>Prophets,</hi> or, ſince the Coming of our <hi>bleſſed Saviour,</hi> by his <hi>Apostles,</hi> I acknowledg them all, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce to conſider the <hi>ſplendor, beauty, excellency and comfort</hi> that is contained in <hi>thoſe Scriptures.</hi> For whether ſuch <hi>ſentences</hi> were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, before Chriſts Coming, by the <hi>Prophets,</hi> or, ſince his Coming, by the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> they were all Gods Miniſters, his Meſſengers, his Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors, bleſſed Meſſengers, God ſent them, his Word is true and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, unalterable.</p>
            <p>I conſider, That God that ſent <hi>thoſe ſentences</hi> is not, as man, vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that is to ſay, of ſeveral mindes, but is <hi>the ſame yeſterday, to day, and for ever;</hi> Therefore I hope God will not ſo far leave me, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe <hi>the authority of his Word;</hi> for I had rather my tongue ſhould cleave to the roof of my mouth, and that my hand ſhould loſe its uſe, then that I ſhould refuſe or diſlike the Word of God, the rule or ſquare of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and one of <hi>Jeruſalems</hi> chief joys. Within that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Word is contained all <hi>thoſe precious ſtreams</hi> that <hi>refreſh and make glad Jeruſalem, the City of God.</hi> God <hi>hath magnified his Word above all his Name, Pſal.</hi> 138.2. I hope none dare preſume to ſpeak any thing, to cavil againſt the Word of God.</p>
            <p>Moſt of <hi>the ſentences,</hi> ſo alledged by Mr <hi>Prynne,</hi> being the Word of God, I do acknowledg (and to my underſtanding) they are of moral equity and uſe: I do except againſt none; I have not exactly view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all.</p>
            <pb n="50" facs="tcp:117747:27"/>
            <p>I do acknowledg likewiſe, That he hath drawn many neceſſary <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations</hi> and <hi>Concluſions</hi> from the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> ſuch as (I do beleeve) are agreeable to the Will of God, as they are <hi>the truths of God.</hi> Yet I ſhould humbly deſire M. <hi>Pryn</hi> to review his Labors, wherin, I do beleeve, he may (if God help him) finde cauſe to revoke <hi>certain matters</hi> there in that Book contained.</p>
            <p>Two things, in my apprehenſion, are very offenſive and ſinful:</p>
            <p>Firſt, The jeering, or deriding men, under the names of <hi>the Saints,</hi> or <hi>the Brethren.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, For that it ſeemeth to me that he doth turn the edg of the Sword againſt many of thoſe that love and fear God, and deſire to do his Will.</p>
            <p>In the firſt leaf (in his Epiſtle directed to the Houſe of Commons) I finde him uſe theſe expreſſions, <hi>To M.</hi> Dell <hi>and his Independent Saints;</hi> and the like again is uſed, <hi>fol.</hi> 2. <hi>Mr</hi> Dell <hi>and ſome of his Saints:</hi> and in the ſame leaf again he expreſſeth himſelf thus, <hi>Saint</hi> Lilburn, <hi>and Saint</hi> Overtons; And a little further thus, <hi>The Sectaries and Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent Saints:</hi> Thus in divers places he reproacheth many under theſe names of <hi>the Saints</hi> and <hi>the Brethren,</hi> and ſuch like terms.</p>
            <p>To my underſtanding this is a juſt cauſe of offence:</p>
            <p>Firſt, Becauſe this name of <hi>Saints,</hi> and of <hi>Brethren,</hi> are not in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves evil, but they are uſed and approved of in the <hi>Scripture phraſes,</hi> as <hi>Deut.</hi> 33.2. <hi>He came with ten thouſands of his Saints.</hi> Pſa. 31.32. <hi>O love the Lord all ye his Saints.</hi> Dan. 7.18. <hi>The Saints of the moſt high.</hi> Mat. 27.52. <hi>Many bodies of Saints.</hi> Rom. 1.7. <hi>Called to be Saints.</hi> And ſo the name of <hi>Brethren, Deut.</hi> 15.7. <hi>&amp;</hi> 33.9. <hi>Pſa.</hi> 122.8. <hi>For my Brethren and Companions.</hi> Rom. 12.1. <hi>I beſeech you therefore Brethren.</hi> I do beleeve, That it is unbeſeeming a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, to call any other Chriſtian, or any man <hi>[Saint]</hi> by way of reproach; We may not play with <hi>holy things:</hi> God giveth this name of <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Brethren</hi> to his Elect, as a Title of honor and reſpect: It cannot be good for any to reproach another with the title, or badg, or cognizance of his own profeſſion.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Becauſe there is more then an appearance of evil in ſuch expreſſions by way of reproach: It was the cuſtom of the <hi>Heathens</hi> to upbraid the Chriſtians by thoſe names, by way of diſgrace. And it is the guiſe and cuſtom of too many profane Engliſh, at this day, to ſcoff and ſcorn thoſe that truly love and fear God under thoſe names of <hi>the Saints,</hi> or <hi>the Brethren.</hi> Do we not know that this is properly
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:117747:27"/> and truly our Titles, our names that we ought to own? For if we be not of the number of <hi>the Saints,</hi> of <hi>the Brethren,</hi> it had been better for us that we had not been: The ungodly are apt enough, and too apt to learn this cuſtom; we need not to put words into their months.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Touching the ſecond <hi>matter</hi> offenſive, it is becauſe he doth often direct, or incite <hi>the Magistrate</hi> againſt <hi>Separates, Anabaptiſts, Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents, &amp;c.</hi> under theſe names, in ſo much that the outward ſhew of his <hi>Writings</hi> ſtrikes much at all of <hi>theſe ſorts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the name of <hi>Separates,</hi> there are few (that doubtleſs he intends) that call themſelves by <hi>that name.</hi> But thus much I ſhould ſay for <hi>that matter,</hi> M. <hi>Pryn</hi> himſelf is a <hi>Separate</hi> in ſome ſence; He is, or ought to be ſeparated from the evil works of the Devil; he will acknowledg that he will ſeparate from thoſe works. Secondly, He is (I beleeve) in <hi>judgment and profeſſion</hi> ſeparated from <hi>Idolaters and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbeleevers.</hi> Thirdly, He is ſeparated, or ought to be ſeparated, from <hi>falſe doctrines,</hi> and from <hi>the openly known, obſtinate, and notorious, ſinful, unrepent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant ſinners.</hi> In theſe ſences (I conceive) he will allow of <hi>Separation:</hi> Therefore all <hi>Separation</hi> is not unlawful.</p>
            <p>It maybe <hi>thoſe Separates,</hi> that he intends, go ſomething further; They ſeparate likewiſe from ſuch <hi>Congregations</hi> as are out of order, conceiving <hi>that where order is not, there will be confuſion in the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of holy things;</hi> conceiving that thereby Gods <hi>precepts</hi> muſt be made voyd by ſuch confuſions: There is not power in the Church to purge and reform things amiſs in the Church. Thus much I would ſay, That, I beleeve, amongſt that number there are many of <hi>thoſe little ones,</hi> concerning whom Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.6. <hi>That it were better that a milſtone were hanged about the neck of them, and that they were caſt into the Sea, that ſhall offend one of them that beleeve in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall propound to conſideration the caſe, firſt of the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> (ſo called;) Theſe deny the <hi>Baptiſm of Children,</hi> (this I beleeve is clearly <hi>their error,</hi>) yet if they differ in <hi>this point</hi> onely, why may they not be ſuffered to live in love and in peace with us, ſo long as they lead a <hi>godly, a peaceable, and a quiet life?</hi> If they do not rail (or ſpeak evil of <hi>Baptiſm</hi> it ſelf) but onely differ concerning the circumſtance of the time when it ſhould be adminiſtred. Let us conſider that we our ſelves do not tie <hi>the Dispenſation</hi> (ſo to an hour, or to a day) but that upon ſeveral occaſions we do differ: So it is to be conſidered concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing divers <hi>other Opinions,</hi> ſo long as they lead a <hi>godly, a peaceable, and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:117747:28"/> a quiet life,</hi> why may not they live lovingly and peaceably amongſt us?</p>
            <p>Conſider circumſpectly, That concerning all perſons (that were not of <hi>the natural ſeed of the Iſraelites</hi>) there is no part of Gods Law (I beleeve) that doth command or binde them to partake with the <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites,</hi> either in the <hi>Paſſeover,</hi> or <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> nor in <hi>other holy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> that were peculiar or proper to the Church of God.</p>
            <p>Conſider likewiſe, That there is no <hi>precept</hi> (I beleeve) in the <hi>Gospel</hi> that giveth <hi>authority</hi> to <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> to <hi>force men to beleeve or practiſe ſuch holy duties:</hi> This is conſiderable, That God hath expreſly given power and command to <hi>Governors,</hi> in divers caſes, to puniſh <hi>matters of commiſſion,</hi> or <hi>evil things,</hi> provided that <hi>Governors</hi> go not beyond the rule. I am no Judg in <hi>theſe matters,</hi> therefore <hi>theſe matters</hi> being weighty, I ſhall refer it to <hi>thoſe</hi> that <hi>God</hi> appointeth to judg.</p>
            <p>This I would ſay to all men, to all <hi>Opinions,</hi> Let us keep cloſe to <hi>Gods rules,</hi> that ſo <hi>God</hi> may chuſe <hi>our Governors</hi> for us; and let not us then fear, for if <hi>Governors</hi> be of <hi>Gods</hi> ſending, <hi>God</hi> will bleſs them with his <hi>Spirit,</hi> they will love the <hi>Flock,</hi> and give <hi>true</hi> and <hi>righteous</hi> and <hi>merciful judgment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>point</hi> is <hi>weighty</hi> in <hi>matter of Separation;</hi> I dare not preſume to determine many <hi>points</hi> in <hi>controverſie</hi> about <hi>that matter:</hi> I do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg (that I do conceive) That <hi>Reformation</hi> is more agreeable to <hi>the Will of God</hi> then <hi>rigid</hi> or <hi>total Separation:</hi> But here I ſpeak onely to defend them from <hi>more violence</hi> then (I conceive) is meet.</p>
            <p>But further, ſuppoſe that <hi>things, matters,</hi> in and concerning <hi>the Worſhip of God,</hi> be ſo unſetled, or diſordered (to <hi>their underſtanding</hi>) that they can ſee no other preſent way to pleaſe <hi>God</hi> but by <hi>Separation;</hi> I had rather leave <hi>them</hi> to <hi>God</hi> to judg, then raſhly to <hi>ſentence them:</hi> I am no Judg in <hi>this matter,</hi> therefore I leave it to <hi>them</hi> to judg <hi>the cauſe,</hi> whom <hi>God</hi> hath appointed for <hi>that purpoſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Touching the <hi>Independents,</hi> I could wiſh that none would acknowledg <hi>that name,</hi> without due and circumſpect <hi>declarations of their intents</hi> touching <hi>Independency.</hi> For there is a direct and <hi>total Independency,</hi> and there is an <hi>Independency</hi> according to <hi>that reference,</hi> or <hi>object,</hi> or <hi>matter,</hi> with which it is compared, or to which it is referred: As for inſtance, if <hi>God</hi> command <hi>one thing,</hi> and <hi>the Magiſtrate</hi> command <hi>that</hi> which is directly contrary thereunto; in <hi>this caſe</hi> a man hath no ſuch dependance upon the <hi>Magiſtate's Authority,</hi> but that <hi>Gods</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand is to be kept, although thereby the command of <hi>the Magiſtrate</hi> be neglected: And I beleeve that this is <hi>the true intent</hi> of thoſe (or
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:117747:28"/> many of thoſe that are called <hi>Independents.</hi> On the contrary it would be a great Error to conceive, That the <hi>Magistrate</hi> is not to meddle in <hi>ſpiritual matters,</hi> as duties of the ſecond Table; for the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> watcheth for <hi>Gods Glory,</hi> he is to ſee <hi>Gods Laws kept,</hi> and the <hi>Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents puniſhed,</hi> according to a Rule preſcribed by <hi>God,</hi> whether it be for the breach of the Duties of the firſt or ſecond Table; and for the diſtinction of Spiritual and Civil, this is evident, That the breach of any Rule, of any Command of God, is of a ſpiritual nature, and either we muſt acknowledg no puniſhment for any ſin, or elſe for all ſins accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a Rule: This is only to be referred to the wiſdom of them ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to judg; many are afraid to acknowledg that power which <hi>God</hi> hath given to Governors, namely, becauſe ſo many Governors have exceeded the Bounds and Limits of the Rule preſcribed, and by that means many have been perſecuted that ſhould have been ſpared.</p>
            <p>Now that which offendeth in this work of Mr <hi>Prynne</hi> (in my appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion) is becauſe he ſtriketh too generally, and by that means endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gereth many that ſhould be ſpared and helped.</p>
            <p>I would not engage to try the equity of the whole work of <hi>The Sword of Chriſtian Magiſtracy Supported,</hi> becauſe I believe God hath not called me to that work, I ſhall leave the conſideration of it to thoſe, that God hath appointed to judg.</p>
            <p>The Caſes that will come to be tryed in this kind, or of this nature, are many, and differ much according to the Objects and Circumſtances, and cannot wholy be ſo determined, but that much muſt be left to the wiſdom of the Governors.</p>
            <p>Concerning the death of the late depoſed King, Mr <hi>John Goodwin</hi> hath learnedly tryed and determined the juſtneſs thereof, (to my beſt underſtanding,) to whom I ſhould refer the Reader; only a word or two I conceive may not be impertinently ſpoken concerning that <hi>matter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt thing that I propound to conſideration is this, namely, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that at and before his Tryal for his Life, his Judgment and Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, he was properly a King, or was depoſed from being a King, ſo that in that condition may we not look upon him as one that had been King, but for ſuch juſt cauſe depoſed, that to the equity thereof, both the Houſes of Parliament, together with the Army, and the Common-wealth, conſented, and were actors therein, and conſented thereto?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Doth not this evidently appear, if we conſider that the <hi>Parliament</hi>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:117747:29"/> formerly, many and ſeveral times, by publique writing, declared, That the King was ſo far a <hi>Delinquent,</hi> that they were forced to diſclaim his former <hi>authority,</hi> and to take up Arms againſt him? In the proſecution of Juſtice, they ſubdued the late King, and his party: Now in this condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the King remained, not being reſtored to his former Kingſhip, which being conſidered, will it not appear, That thoſe that gave ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence againſt him, and thoſe that brought him to his Tryal, and did cauſe Juſtice to be executed upon him, did not take away the life of a King, but of one that had been King, and hoped ſo to have been again?</p>
            <p>Secondly, I do propound to conſideration, <hi>Whether it be not lawful to deſert, and to depoſe Kings, and to bring them to puniſhment, for the breach of the Laws of the moſt high God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This (I believe) appeareth plainly, if we firſt conſider, That both King and People are all Gods Subjects; <hi>God is the King of Kings:</hi> God ſaith, That <hi>one Law ſhall be to all,</hi> Exod. 12.49.</p>
            <p>It is to be conſidered what God gave <hi>Joſhua</hi> in charge, <hi>Ioſh.</hi> 1.8. <hi>Let not this Book of the Law depart out of thy mouth, but meditate therein day and night, that then mayſt obſerve and do according to all things that is written therein.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this very purpoſe God ſpeaketh the ſame matter as the duty of Kings, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.18. <hi>And when he ſhall ſit upon the Throne of his Kingdom, then ſhall he write him this Law repeated in a Book.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Verſ. 19. <hi>And he ſhall read therein all the days of his life, that he may learn to fear the Lord his God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Verſ. 20. <hi>That he may prolong his days in his Kingdom, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From theſe places it appeareth. That both <hi>Ioſhua</hi> and the Kings were to be ſubject to Gods Law, otherwiſe God would have left them to their <hi>liberties,</hi> but contrarily God doth directly impoſe upon them the diligent obſervation of all his Laws.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We may note, That the breach of Gods Laws were puniſhable in Kings, plainly implyed in theſe words, <hi>That it may go well, that his days in his Kingdom may be prolonged;</hi> By this we may plainly ſee, That on the contrary, if a King do neglect and tranſgreſs Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, then his days in his Kingdom may be ſhortned.</p>
            <p>The end wherefore God doth expreſly charge them to regard the Law, importeth plainly, that it was to that end, that it might be their Rule and Bounds: And ſo likewiſe, if by diligent need to Gods Laws the days of Kings may be prolonged, then on the contrary, for the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:117747:29"/> (and much more for the grievous breach of) Gods Laws, their days may be ſhortned.</p>
            <p>To this purpoſe we may read, That although <hi>Ioſhua</hi> were a man that was placed as Governor over <hi>Iſrael</hi> by God himſelf, and although he were ſo eminent a man for piety, a man that had long and conſtantly walked in the ways of God, of whoſe godlineſs the people had had long experience; yet obſerve what the people anſwered to <hi>Ioſhua</hi> in point of their obedience, recorded <hi>Joſh.</hi> 1.16. <hi>Then they anſwered Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua, ſaying, All that thou haſt commanded us we will do, &amp;c.</hi> Verſ. 17. <hi>As we obeyed Moſes in all things, ſo will we obey thee; only the Lord thy God be with thee, as he was with Moſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence we may obſerve, in theſe words, <hi>Only the Lord thy God be with thee, as he was with Moſes,</hi> is plainly implyed a conditional ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection in the people; as if the people ſhould have ſaid, We deſire to be excuſed, in caſe that we do ſee it appear by thoſe fruits that thou bringeſt forth, that God is departed from thee, and that thou forſakeſt thoſe paths in which God hath commanded us to walk, and hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded thee to obſerve, in ſuch caſes we will be free, we do not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to be obedient to thee: This is a plain conditional engagement, implyed plainly in thoſe words, <hi>Only the Lord thy God be with thee, as he was with Moſes.</hi> There is no King, Emperor or Governor whatſoever, but they are included all of them within the Rule of Gods Law, that is to be the Rule and Guide of all their Actions, the Bounds thereof they may not paſs by, turning aſide either to the right or to the left hand, nor by adding to the Commandments of God, nor by taking any thing from Gods Commandments. <hi>Moſes</hi> was a notable, excellent, and eminent Example to Governors, he obſerved Gods Laws willingly and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectly, ſo did <hi>Joſhua,</hi> and all thoſe Judges that were choſen immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately by God: Thus <hi>David</hi> did endeavor to walk in Gods ways, and ſome of the Kings of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> although they lay under <hi>great temptations,</hi> being lifted up ſo high in the opinions of the people; theſe all acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged the Law of God to be their Rule, their Guide, and their Bounds.</p>
            <p>For the breach of this Law old <hi>Eli</hi> was puniſhed with temporal death, although in his own perſon he were circumſpect and obedient, yet becauſe that he ſuffered Gods Laws to be violated by his own ſons, God is ſo provoked, that he taketh away his ſons by the ſword, and the father by an untimely death; an eminent pattern for Governors to look upon.</p>
            <p>Governors are leading men, their example is more prevalent then
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:117747:30"/> others, they do more hurt then others by their evil examples, therefore great men ſhall be greatly tormented.</p>
            <p>God ſpared not Kings that broke and violated his Law: <hi>Saul,</hi> though he was choſen to his place by God immediately, and therefore was anointed with oyl after an extraordinary manner, yet when he went beyond the Bounds of Gods Commandments, though it were in offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sacrifice, a matter good in it ſelf, yet becauſe it was more then God commanded, God caſt him out of his place for it. If we add to Gods Will revealed in his Word, we ſin, or if we deminiſh.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>But is there any preſident or example that warranteth a people to depoſe and puniſh their Governors?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The condition expreſſed, and recorded in the Book of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> doth plainly hold out, That the whole body of a people, or ſuch as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent, or are Deputies for the <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> or part of that body, may, in caſes wherein their Governors act not for God, but contrary to his revealed Will, in ſuch caſes (I conceive) the Word, recorded in the Book of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> plainly warranteth, and teacheth people, That they ought to make ſuch exceptions: This people that gave <hi>Joſhua</hi> his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, were a part of the people; And although this Covenant, or Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veat, had not been expreſſed, yet it had been the peoples duty and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to follow him in Gods ways, but not other ways.</p>
            <p>If we take notice, and conſider that place, recorded <hi>Numb.</hi> 25.1. <hi>The people began to commit whoredom with the daughters of Moab, &amp;c.</hi> The people for this cauſe were commanded by God to ſlay thoſe Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors that were guilty in this matter; <hi>The Lord ſaid to Moſes, Take all the heads of the people, and hang them up before the Lord a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Sun, that the fierce wrath of the Lord may be turned from Iſrael,</hi> Numb. 25.4.</p>
            <p>Now this ſheweth, That it is Gods Will that Governors ſhall by the people be puniſhed in ſuch caſes as are notorious breaches of Gods Law; for although theſe Governors were not equal, but inferiour to <hi>Moſes,</hi> yet they were Governors of the people; as for example, all Governors are not Emperors, nor all Kings, nor all Judges, of an equal rank, yet they are all of one kind, Gods Law bindeth, and hath the ſame authority over all.</p>
            <p>But further, conſider this, it is there recorded for our learning, <hi>Num.</hi> 25.6. <hi>That one of the children of Iſrael brought unto his brethren a Midianitiſh woman, in the ſight of Moſes, and in the ſight of, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Note, That this man <hi>was a Prince,</hi> Verſ. 14.</p>
            <pb n="57" facs="tcp:117747:30"/>
            <p>Verſ. 7. <hi>And when Phineas the ſon of Aaron ſaw it, he roſe up, &amp;c. and took a ſpear in his hand, and followed the man of Iſrael into the Tent; and thruſt them both through, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From this Text it plainly appeareth, That in ſuch openly known ſins Princes are liable to puniſhment; nay further, That God taketh this as a matter that is ſo acceptable to him, that he rewardeth it with an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary commendation and reward.</p>
            <p>Verſ. 10. <hi>Then the Lord ſpake unto Moſes, ſaying, Phineas, the ſon of Aaron, hath turned mine anger away from the children of Iſrael, while he was zealous for my ſake amongst them, therefore I have not conſumed the children of Iſrael in my jealouſie.</hi> Verſ. 12. <hi>Wherefore I ſay unto him, Behold I give unto him my Covenant of Peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here note, That <hi>Phineas</hi> ſtood not to ſearch over the Punctilioes of the Common Laws, neither was he a Judg, nor ordinary Officer to put men to death, he ſtayed not till this man was tryed by his Peers, but he conſidered that God was highly diſhonored, the caſe was extraordinary, therfore, he put his life in his hand, and couragiouſly &amp; zealouſly purſued the tranſgreſſor, and ſlew him, this is recorded for our learning; <hi>Ro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> 15.4. <hi>Whatſoever things are written aforetime, are writen for our learning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is to be admired, That people they ſhould be offended at the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi> and at ſome of the <hi>Parliament,</hi> becauſe they executed Juſtice upon ſuch an offender as had ſinned in the ſight of the Sun, by ſetting up <hi>Idolatry;</hi> that had ſinned, in ſhedding innocent blood; ſuch an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender as was tryed and found guilty to the knowledg of the Land, and by the opinion of <hi>Lords, Commons, Army,</hi> and <hi>People,</hi> witneſs their Writings in Print; and is this ſo hainous a matter?</p>
            <p>This maketh me call to mind the Prophecy, <hi>Revel.</hi> 18.16, 17. <hi>Alas, alas, that great City that was clothed in fine linnen, and purple, and ſcarlet, and guilded with gold, and precious ſtones, and pearls; For in one hour ſo great riches are come to deſolation: And every ſhip-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and all the people that ocupy ſhips, and whoſoever doth trafique on the ſea, ſhall ſtand afar off, and cry, &amp;c.</hi> But what ſaith the Spirit of God? Verſ. 10. <hi>O Haeven, rejoyce over her, and ye holy Apoſtles, for God hath puniſhed her to be revenged on her for your ſakes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Dear Friends, you that are not drunk, but in good frames of heart, conſider, that this great Tower of Confuſion is fallen; the Prophets foretold of theſe days, <hi>Iſaiah, Daniel, Hoſea, Micah,</hi> and others, they tell us plainly, That corrupt Governors muſt down; I believe the time is accompliſhed that God did in his counſel determine theſe matters,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:117747:31"/> therefore hang down your heads no longer, but you that wait for the <hi>Salvation of Iſrael</hi> lift up your heads.</p>
            <p>I pray you, Countrymen, note, That the <hi>Army</hi> and the <hi>Parliament</hi> they being zealous for Gods glory, they put their lives in their hands, they look all oppoſitions in the face, they executed Juſtice upon an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender; this was Gods work that guarded them with ſtrength, this act of theirs was beyond their own abilities: I pray you compare this act with that of <hi>Phineas,</hi> is not there the ſame cauſe in the offender? Is not the zeal of <hi>Phineas</hi> and their zeal like in the very countenance, and of near affinity? And hath not God crowned this act of theirs? Conſider, that God hath bleſſed the fruits of the earth, and hath enrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our barns and ſtores; Hath not God bleſſed us in our fiſhing abroad? not the like for many years before: Hath not God bleſſed us by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving us Victories at Sea, and Victories at the Land? Whitherſoever they turn themſelves they are bleſſed, ſince the death of the late King.</p>
            <p>This maketh me commend to your conſideration that bleſſing that God gave to <hi>Joſhua,</hi> and is acknowledged thus, <hi>There was not a City that God delivered not into his hand, nor place was too ſtrong for him:</hi> Conſider it well, and apply it. If any will be obſtinate and blind, let them be ſo, I cannot help it.</p>
            <p>But to go on, in 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 11.15 <hi>Jehojada the Prieſt commanded the Captains of the Hundreds that had the rule of the Hoſt.</hi> Verſ. 16. <hi>And they laid hands on her, &amp;c. and there ſhe was ſlain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We may here obſerve, That there is a preſident recorded in Scripture that ſheweth, That when a principal Governor ſhall do evil in the ſight of the Lord, the people did account it to be their duties to puniſh ſuch great offenders and offences by death; thus was <hi>Jeſabel</hi> ſlain.</p>
            <p>The example of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> likewiſe is conſiderable, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 12.20. where the ten Tribes by reaſon that <hi>Rehoboam</hi> would not hearken to them, in eaſing them of thoſe Taxations that they ſaid were too heavy, they therefore depoſed or rejected him from being their King; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that <hi>Jeroboam</hi> forſook Gods Commandments afterwards, that was his ſin: But touching their act in caſting off, and renouncing all obedience to <hi>Rehoboam</hi> for his ſin of oppreſſion, God plainly alloweth that, and owneth that act of the peoples, as appeareth, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 12.24. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, Ye ſhall not go up, nor fight againſt your brethren; for this thing is done by me.</hi> The peoples ſin lay in another way, <hi>They enquired not of the Lord who ſhould govern them,</hi> therein lay their evil: From that root ſprung up their error, and this error was the very
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:117747:31"/> cauſe (I do undoubtedly believe) that they had ſo many corrupt Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors that ruled over them: It may evidently be ſeen, that men uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally run into extreams, and all is, becauſe they are not circumſpect in following Gods Commandments, they depart from the Rule.</p>
            <p>Now, dearly beloved Countrymen, I judg it will be ſeaſonable (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſuch precious liberties are not uſual) to conſider a little what our condition is, and what we are, and in what relation we do truly ſtand, according to the true Rule of Gods ſacred Word, the moſt bleſſed and unerring Rule of Truth.</p>
            <p>God in great, rich and ſingular mercy (undeſerved by us) hath put a great difference between us and the beaſts of the field, and between us and theſe ſenſleſs creatures, lands, houſes, and ſuch earthly inheritances. How cometh it then to paſs, That when a King dyeth (the breath is ſcarcely out of his body, or his body quite cold) there is ſuch poſt-haſte, ſuch running and riding to proclaim one King in his room; what is the matter of ſuch great haſte? ſurely there is ſomething in it: Do they not take us, as young heirs take their fathers inheritance, as beaſts, lands, houſes.</p>
            <p>This maketh me to conſider ſometimes the manner and actings of ſuch men of War as do live upon the labours of honeſt and true men; they, when they eſpy a prey, preſently up top-ſail, top gallant ſails, and all the ſails; it were oft-times better for the true honeſt and plain-deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men, that they ſhould make leſs haſte: obſerve it well, your honeſt Merchant men make leſs ſpeed to purſue after others, becauſe they mind their own: Surely <hi>Moſes,</hi> that godly man, made no ſuch haſte, nor did the good Iudges of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> they ſtayed till they were called by <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Certainly I ſhould note it to be the Character of a good Shepherd, or <hi>Governor,</hi> when they do firſt conſider the great weight and concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (for Gods glory, and for the peoples good) that <hi>Government</hi> is of; certainly if it be heartily and duly conſidered, there is not juſt cauſe for ſo great haſte; <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Gideon,</hi> and the reſt, conſidered the great weight, for ſaith <hi>Moſes, My abilities are but weak;</hi> and <hi>Gideon</hi> ſaid, he was <hi>but mean</hi> (in his own eſteem) <hi>for ſuch a work;</hi> it is like they conſidered, That except <hi>God</hi> did in an extraordinary manner promiſe to aſſiſt them with his bleſſed Spirit, they ſhould be inſufficient for ſo weighty employments.</p>
            <p>Indeed if any look at their own glory, and eaſe, and worldly riches, it is no marvel then if ſuch make ſpeed: but conſider, that if any want Gods bleſſed Spirit, into what a truly miſerable condition do they
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:117747:32"/> plunge both themſelves, and thoſe poor people that muſt be judged, preſerved, and protected by them? I do confeſs, I ſee no ſuch cauſe of haſte, when matters are truly conſidered of: There will or would be leſs bloodſhed, and more peace, if men were truly conſciencious of their duties; Crowns would be of leſs eſteem.</p>
            <p>It is well to be noted, That in the firſt and pureſt times, <hi>God</hi> owned and bleſſed the people as his proper and peculiar inheritance, and ſo carryed himſelf to them; for <hi>Moſes</hi> had children, yet <hi>God</hi> ſo honoured and loved the people, that he did not leave them, the people, to the Judges, as their inheritance, (although the Judges were bleſſed Judges) but did keep them as his own inheritance, and ſo provided men, (whoſe inward affections he knew) and <hi>God</hi> did immediately appoint Judges himſelf for them, and thoſe <hi>God</hi> bleſſed with his good Spirit all of them; ſuch did not claim the people as their inheritance, and ſo leave them as beaſts, lands, or houſes to their children; this continued all the time of the Judges: But when the people preferred their own inventions before the wiſdom of <hi>God,</hi> and would be governed by a King, and ſo caſt off <hi>God</hi> from raigning over them, then a declining <hi>people,</hi> and a forſaking <hi>God:</hi> Not long after <hi>God</hi> made <hi>David</hi> a promiſe, That ſome of his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity ſhould hold the people as their inheritance in ſome proportion; <hi>Government</hi> went then by Succeſſion.</p>
            <p>But conſider now (beloved Countrymen) That there is no King up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth hath ſuch a promiſe as <hi>David</hi> had; now the partition wall is broken down, <hi>God</hi> is reconciled; if we believe therefore for any King now to claim <hi>Government</hi> by Succeſſion, they muſt ſhew ſome Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſome gift from <hi>God</hi> for it; for my part, I have ſearched the ſacred Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of Gods Will revealed, and in all the Word of God I can ſee no ſuch <hi>Scripture;</hi> if they can ſhew any hidden light, let it be ſhewn, that I may ſee it too, but till then I ſhall conceive, that we (Believers) are <hi>Gods inheritance,</hi> and <hi>God,</hi> by my conſent, ſhall be our King, and appoint our <hi>Governors</hi> in his own way, and then I am ſure this people; I, and my poſterity may reſt in ſecure peace, for then <hi>God</hi> will not fail to bleſs ſuch <hi>Governors</hi> with his good and bleſſed Spirit.</p>
            <p>Beloved Countrymen, <hi>GOD</hi> hath preferred us in honor above beaſts, or lands; and ſhall we like thoſe aſſes, beaſts, proſtrate our ſelves to ſuch a ſervile condition?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But ſuppoſe a King can ſay, <hi>His forefathers obtained the Kingdom by the Sword, by Conqueſt?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I look upon <hi>that</hi> as the worſt and meaneſt <hi>title</hi> of all: For
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:117747:32"/> our <hi>Indians</hi> (that know not God) can ſhew ſuch a <hi>title</hi> for their unjuſt <hi>encroachments upon other mens Lives and Eſtates.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And conſider, <hi>That that man that poſſeſſeth but the Goods or Lands of another mans by violence, ſhall hold that no longer then till the other man hath power to take them again:</hi> but we acknowledg a God, and his Word muſt be our guide.</p>
            <p>But further conſider, That ſuppoſe that we ſhould grant to a King as good a title to <hi>Government</hi> as <hi>Moſes, Joſhua, Saul,</hi> had, who were men immediately appointed by God, (which no King (I beleeve) can ſhew the like) yet theſe could not rightfully claim the people as <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance</hi> to leave to their Children, <hi>that is Gods proper right, and God is a jealous God.</hi> Kings muſt therefore ſhew ſuch a Promiſe, made to them by God (and recorded in Gods Word) as <hi>David</hi> had, or elſe I muſt deſire leave to be excuſed, if I conceive that I and my poſterity, <hi>through the gracious bounty of a good God in Chriſt,</hi> do look upon my ſelf as free, and not as a bond-man.</p>
            <p>And yet further, Could Kings ſhew as good a promiſe as <hi>David</hi> had, yet God muſt chuſe the man which ſhould be Governor; For Gods Word is expreſs, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. <hi>Thou ſhalt make him King whom the Lord thy God ſhall chuſe:</hi> This is a <hi>ſentence</hi> recorded, and never repealed to this day. There is an apparent difference in Gods Word, between man chuſing the man, and God chuſing the man, <hi>Samuel</hi> had order from God to appoint one of <hi>Iſhai</hi> his ſons to the <hi>Government</hi> and yet nevertheleſs God would not give <hi>Samuel</hi> that priviledg to chuſe the man, God reſerved that honor to himſelf: Good it had been for the people, had they kept cloſe to God in <hi>that particular.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beloved Country-men, <hi>Cuſtom</hi> hath worn out <hi>Truth;</hi> but let us enquire for <hi>the old and good ways of our gracious God:</hi> Chriſt ſaith, <hi>It was not ſo in the beginning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Further conſider, That all Governors, high and low, they are all ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Gods Commandments, both <hi>to do,</hi> and <hi>to ſuffer;</hi> For if we ſhould admit that the Chief Governors (call them by what Titles you will) were to be free from <hi>puniſhment,</hi> ſhould we not by <hi>that means</hi> diminiſh part of Gods Laws, which containeth <hi>two parts,</hi> namely, <hi>for man to do, or to ſuffer?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Conſider further, That <hi>that</hi> Law of God that bindeth all men (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſpect of perſons) to <hi>the obſervation of it,</hi> muſt of neceſſity al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low a way for <hi>the obſervation of it;</hi> would it not otherwiſe ſhew an imperfection in it?</p>
            <pb n="62" facs="tcp:117747:33"/>
            <p>Now for men to ſay, <hi>That chief Governors are onely accountable to God;</hi> Conſider that God is in Heaven, and hath given us his Laws, wholy to be obſerved upon Earth, by all men, high and low, either by doing, or ſuffering; therefore we, having Gods Laws upon Earth here below, muſt ſee them obſerved by all men, by doing or ſuffering. Is it not an abſurd thing to ſay, <hi>That when a man breaketh Gods Laws upon Earth, he muſt be puniſhed onely in Heaven?</hi> and in the mean time be ſuffered to run forward to do more miſchief: There will be another account to be given there, and other puniſhments, <hi>without Faith and Repentance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Conſider further, That God, for the ſins of Kings, gave commiſſion to men on Earth to put them them to death, read 2 <hi>King.</hi> 9.7. <hi>And thou ſhalt ſmite all the houſe of Ahab thy maſter, that I may avenge the blood of my ſervants the Prophets, and the blood of all the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of the Lord: For the whole houſe of Ahab ſhall be deſtroyed.</hi> Now note what followed; 2 <hi>King.</hi> 10.30. <hi>And the Lord ſaid unto Jehu, becauſe thou haſt diligently executed that which was right in my eyes, and haſt done unto the houſe of Ahab according to all things that were in my heart; therefore thy ſons, unto the fourth generation, ſhall ſit upon the Throne of Iſrael.</hi> Now (before this) we may note, That <hi>Jehu</hi> had not onely ſlain <hi>Jehoram,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 9.24. but alſo <hi>Aha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziah</hi> King of <hi>Judah,</hi> verſ. 27. We may obſerve, That this <hi>Ahaziah</hi> was noted <hi>to do evil in the ſight of the Lord;</hi> Chap. 8.27. And there he is noted for <hi>marrying a woman addicted to Idolatry;</hi> after this God commendeth <hi>Jehu.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This I beleeve, That in all parts of the World where Kings are, and are lawfully (according to Gods will) made Kings, if I were there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, I ſhould labor (in all lawful <hi>matters</hi>) to be obedient to them; and I beleeve that it is the duty of all men ſo to do: But in any place, where ever ſuch Governors ſhall turn from Gods Commandments, and ſhall draw people from Gods Service, and ſhall (in ſtead of feeding, defending, and ſeeking the good of the Flock) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ek to devour and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the Flock, doubtleſs Gods Laws have force againſt them in ſuch caſes: And alſo, if in Gods way I might be free, I ſhould chuſe it much ſooner; for ſervitude is not pleaſing. But where Governors are called by God, in his own way, there God will bleſs them with his good Spirit; Therefore I chuſe willingly to be obedient to ſuch, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that is my greateſt comfort (under God) and is indeed <hi>true Liberty.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="63" facs="tcp:117747:33"/>
            <p>My purpoſe was to have been large in this matter; but there is come to my hand a Book written by one Mr <hi>John Goodwin,</hi> called, <hi>The Defence of the Honorable Sentence paſſed upon the late King by the High Court of Juſtice,</hi> to which Book I refer the Reader for fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſatisfaction; He hath written largely, learnedly, and faithfully up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that ſubject, ſo far as I am able to judg.</p>
            <p>I ſhould deſire all men to wait patiently upon <hi>God,</hi> and I do undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly beleeve <hi>God</hi> will further clear theſe proceedings. I do beleeve the time is come that the <hi>Government</hi> by Kings is finiſhed in our Land: To my beſt underſtanding the Prophets ſpeak evidently, <hi>That God will reſtore Judges as at the firſt; Then ſhall we be called a faithful City, a City of Righteouſneſs, Iſai.</hi> 1.26.</p>
            <p>Now I ſhall humbly crave leave of the Miniſters and Meſſengers of the Lord, that I may, without offence to them (or to any others, for I deſire to walk without giving any juſt cauſe of offence to any man whatſoever) ſpeak a word to them.</p>
            <p>I do perceive divers of the Miniſtry do, or have taken offence at the proceedings of the <hi>Army,</hi> and of the <hi>preſent Government.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beloved, dearly beloved <hi>Fathers,</hi> you are men whom I love, and have in high eſtimation for your works ſake; <hi>How beautiful are the feet of thoſe that bring the glad tydings of peace and of ſalvation!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I deſire that I may propound to your conſideration ſome few lines: You ſee that by reaſon of the late Wars (and becauſe the <hi>State</hi> hath yet had ſo much buſineſs) there is not that Reformation of many things amiſs, as it were to be (and is) deſired.</p>
            <p>I pray you to conſider, you are converſant in the <hi>meditation</hi> of <hi>Gods Law;</hi> You (I beleeve) exhort the people to turn from <hi>their evil ways,</hi> and to be obedient to, and obſervant of <hi>Gods Laws:</hi> I humbly deſire you to give a good example to the people, they look much upon your actings; You ſtudy the Word of <hi>God;</hi> I beſeech you do not hinder the work of the Lord: If you deſire Reformation let it be done or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly, and then it will proſper; Therefore I pray you to ſtrengthen the hands of the <hi>preſent Government,</hi> which I beleeve do truly endeavor to do <hi>Gods</hi> will: encourage the <hi>Army,</hi> with whom <hi>Gods</hi> gracious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence is evidently to be ſeen. There are offences too many abroad; <hi>but woe be to them</hi> (ſaith our bleſſed Saviour) <hi>by whom offences do come:</hi> I do beſeech you to conſider whether or no, there would not have been much more Reformation, if you had not drawn back, and diſcouraged in a great meaſure <hi>this preſent Government.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="64" facs="tcp:117747:34"/>
            <p>I humbly beſeech you, (if you know any that do publiquely ſow or ſtir up ſtrife) I pray you to perſwade them to forbear. Conſider I pray you, you know <hi>that a Kingdom divided is dangerous, and it cannot ſtand with ſafety and comfort.</hi> I pray you call to minde that motherly and tender reſpect <hi>Rebecca</hi> ſhewed to both her children; <hi>Eſau</hi> being offended with <hi>Jacob, Rebecca</hi> doth not ſeek to make a party, although ſhe knew that <hi>Jacob</hi> was her obedient ſon, and had obtained both the <hi>birth-right</hi> and the <hi>bleſſing,</hi> by means whereof <hi>Jacob</hi> was truly <hi>Eſau</hi> his ſuperior; but ſhe conſidered the dangerous conſequences of mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt diviſion between ſuch neer relations, between <hi>Brethren;</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe rather parts with her beloved ſon <hi>Jacob,</hi> and giveth <hi>Jacob</hi> this reaſon, <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 27.45. <hi>Why ſhould I be deprived of you both in one day?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I pray you conſider that we have ſuffered much already: If any ſhould endeavor to bring new and more dangerous breaches, would it not be very grievous? Are there not ſome that by their publike practiſes have ſo divided our families, and our friends already, that one friend dareth hardly truſt another?</p>
            <p>Conſider I pray you, That <hi>this preſent Government</hi> are men that ſeek your honor, your good, and your peace, ſo far as <hi>God</hi> ſheweth to them that it may be for <hi>Gods</hi> glory and the good of the Land: and would ſuch diſcontented men forbear ſuch direct and ſuch palpable provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I beleeve the deſires of this <hi>Government</hi> is to honor and reſpect the Miniſtry yet more.</p>
            <p>Conſider what will be the iſſue of ſuch mens endeavors that ſeek to ſtir up ſtrife: It is not poſſible to avoyd, but that either the <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> muſt fall, or ſuch as ſow diſcord muſt fall: Theſe <hi>matters</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not long be ſuffered with the ſafety of the Land.</p>
            <p>Now therefore conſider the Government loveth you, and (I am veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſwaded) would paſs by former offences, provided that for the future there might be an <hi>amendment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I do beleeve that you have done what you have done (in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure) with zeal; I do conſider that <hi>Peter</hi> ſwerved more then once; and likewiſe that in many things we ſin all.</p>
            <p>There is much wickedneſs committed by too many, and likewiſe there are many unſound Opinions, many corrupt Opinions: You deſire theſe <hi>matters</hi> may be amended; Then I do beſeech you that you will ſeek to ſtrengthen the hands of the Governors: Is it poſſible that they ſhould work a Reformation, if you ſhould divide your ſelves? Did
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:117747:34"/> not <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> go hand in hand?</p>
            <p>I am ſenſible of the <hi>matters that offend you;</hi> do but obtain this, namely, <hi>That a Governmont may be eſtabliſhed, countenanced, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed;</hi> I mean, ſuch a <hi>Government as God hath preſcribed,</hi> (owned and bleſſed in his <hi>holy Word,</hi>) and I dare engage that it is the neareſt way to obtain your deſires; only in that pray earneſtly, as a <hi>matter of concernment.</hi> Touching the <hi>Government by Kings,</hi> they are gone and paſt, labour not to bring them again, for certainly it is evident, <hi>that that ſhall neither be according to Gods mind, nor for your comfort.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If men, famous in the <hi>Congregation,</hi> withſtand <hi>Moſes,</hi> it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>that the whole Congregation be out of order: Moſes</hi> muſt be ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened and obeyed, that ſo the true <hi>Levites</hi> may do their duty, and be defended from injurious perſons; but if men famous do withſtand <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> to his face, yet <hi>God</hi> will vindicate and defend his cauſe, <hi>Moſes</hi>'s true authority ſhall ſtand. Touching theſe <hi>corruptions</hi> and <hi>evil opinions,</hi> do but give <hi>Moſes</hi> his authority, and God will give him his Spirit in ſuch a meaſure, that vice will fly away as chaff before the wind.</p>
            <p>Concerning theſe <hi>evil and corrupt opinions,</hi> that in theſe troubleſom times have evidently appeared, conſider this, <hi>That God can make all work together for the good of his Elect;</hi> they may ſee thereby the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils with grief and deteſtation, they may ſee of what great concernment of what benefit, of what neceſſity it is, that there ſhould be <hi>Governors</hi> to defend them from the violence of the wicked, to defend them from erronious perſons, to ſupport Gods Word and his Laws, to puniſh De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquents, and ungodly men, that ſo the fierce anger of God may be turned away from us: <hi>Pharaohs</hi> oppreſſions, and <hi>Iſraels</hi> ſufferings in <hi>Egypt;</hi> God in his wiſdom uſed them for the inſtructions of his people afterwards: And in the very beginning, and next before the delivery of the Law, God recorded that to be remembred, as being of eminent uſe and inſtruction to his people, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.1, 2. <hi>God ſpake all theſe words, ſaying, I am the Lord thy God which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the houſe of bondage.</hi> This God (by <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets</hi> afterward) uſed as an effectual argument to invite to, and to put the people in mind of their duties, <hi>Remember thou waſt a bondman, Pharaoh an oppreſſor, and I delivered you, therefore, &amp;c.</hi> Bread or food is moſt welcom to us when we be moſt hungry. <hi>England</hi> was wanton, and proud, and full; God now proveth them. God (I believe) is about an <hi>eminent and great work of Reformation,</hi> marvel not therefore if God leave the impreſſion of tyranny and wickedneſs, in a more then ordinary manner, to be recorded to poſterity.</p>
            <pb n="66" facs="tcp:117747:35"/>
            <p>Dearly beloved Fathers, I pray you ſuffer me (without offence to you) to propound this to your conſideration, namely, That foraſmuch as there hath been and is ſuch a great and too general falling off from the true ways of God, in the practiſe of godlineſs, ſin having ſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally over-ſpread the Land in the open ſight of God and men; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my humble Requeſt to you is, That you will conſider whether it be not now a ſeaſon to gather your Churches (ſuch as are not already) into good order, let <hi>the Septer of Christs Authority</hi> be advanced o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly, ſo that all men may ſee that you have power of the <hi>Keys</hi> and <hi>Cenſures,</hi> and that there may be ſome outward ſolemn act, (the form I leave to your wiſdoms, only it muſt be equivalent to a <hi>Covenant</hi>) whereby the people, that ſhall willingly avow or acknowledg God, and Jeſus Chriſt to be their God, (in ſuch a manner that they willingly will ſubmit to him in all the ways of his Worſhip, according as it is revealed and recorded in his holy Word the <hi>Scriptures,</hi>) may be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly gathered into <hi>fellowſhips,</hi> and all known ſinners may be hereby brought to <hi>repentance:</hi> This will be a means, that many that now divide (and ſtumble at the prophaneneſs that is in many places ſuffered, and the diſorder and want of power that is conceived to be in many <hi>Congregations</hi>) will give and reach out unto you <hi>the right hand of fellowſhip.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I would not preſcribe the way preciſely, but ſo far as you may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive my meaning: This may be a way to curb and cut down much prophaneneſs; and if God give you hearts to ſtand up and labour dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently to do Gods will herein with courage, induſtry, and all your might, I hope your labour will not be loſt.</p>
            <p>I cannot but with humble (hearty and unfeigned) thankfulneſs to God, acknowledg his great mercy to us, (who have highly <hi>provoked God by our crooked and froward behaviours,</hi>) in and for that <hi>God</hi> hath ſtirred up many <hi>godly Ministers and People</hi> to reform many things even now in theſe <hi>troubleſom times:</hi> I humbly pray you, labour now with all diligence to go on and perfect (ſo much as in you lieth) <hi>the Work of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Conſider (I pray you) That <hi>Iſrael</hi> repeated or renewed their <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants</hi> upon ſeveral occaſions. None (that are godly) can take any juſt cauſe of offence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Paul</hi> became all things to all men, that by all means he might win ſome; and the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> guided by <hi>Gods holy Spirit,</hi> rejoyced to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold <hi>the Order of the Churches of God; God is the God of Order.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="67" facs="tcp:117747:35"/>
            <p>And the rather now I put you in mind of it, becauſe now you have an opportunity to do it, do it therefore circumſpectly and ſpeedily, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſuch precious times of <hi>Reformation,</hi> as now you have, are not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary: And the rather now do it, becauſe the <hi>Government</hi> (I doubt not) is ready to ſupport and ſtrengthen you in this <hi>great and excellent work of Reformation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One matter more, Beloved Fathers, I humble deſire you to take in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to conſideration, <hi>If you ſhould diſcourage this preſent Government</hi> (being men that do deſire affectionately to do Gods will, I am verily perſwaded,) <hi>and if you ſhould labour again to bring a Government over us by Kings,</hi> (which God forbid;) weigh well theſe two <hi>mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> (I pray you,) firſt concerning Kings: You are both uncertain of obtaining a King, and alſo unlikely; and what effects and fruits ſuch <hi>endeavors</hi> will produce in the iſſue, who can tell? It may occaſion much <hi>trouble</hi> to thoſe that deſire to live in <hi>peace.</hi> Can you tell whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the King you deſire or labour for (if you ſhould do ſo) be <hi>wiſe or fooliſh?</hi> whether he be <hi>godly or ungodly,</hi> what experience have we of it? Doubtleſs it is a <hi>matter of high and exceeding great concernment,</hi> who we receive to rule over us. But what if he ſhould prove a <hi>perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi> both of you and <hi>Gods people?</hi> Is it not very hazardable? For in <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment by Kings</hi> we muſt take the next of kindred by birth, though we ſhould evidently ſee that he were an <hi>evil perſon,</hi> or elſe we muſt <hi>endure another War.</hi> But ſuppoſe we ſhould obtain a <hi>good King,</hi> yet we know that they are ſet in ſlippery places, he may <hi>ſoon</hi> be taken away: What then? his next of kin, or his next <hi>ſucceſſor</hi> may be a <hi>perſecutor.</hi> We have had many <hi>experiences</hi> in this kind to teach us, and yet I fear we have profited <hi>too little:</hi> King <hi>Edward</hi> a hopeful King, quickly gone; the next Queen <hi>Mary</hi> perſecuted his <hi>moſt beloved friends:</hi> Search the <hi>Records of holy Writ,</hi> and there <hi>God</hi> plainly ſheweth (which <hi>God</hi> plainly foretold) the bitter fruits that the people ſhould reap by having Kings: We may behold what miſerable fruits the people reap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Kings; <hi>Solomon,</hi> heavy Taxations, <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> Idolatry: It would be too long to reckon up <hi>Ahab,</hi> and others, and ſome in the ſtreets ſhed <hi>the blood of innocents.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But amongſt all the <hi>Judges</hi> there was not one man but he was bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of <hi>God,</hi> and was a bleſſing to the <hi>people,</hi> if he were called and entred into his place by <hi>Gods Appointment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed when <hi>people</hi> will not conſult with (and enquire of) <hi>God,</hi> to know who <hi>God</hi> ſeeth meet to govern them, then <hi>God</hi> may juſtly leave
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:117747:36"/> them to their own choyce, to chuſe a King <hi>Abimelech,</hi> that may prove a ſcourge to them.</p>
            <p>But ſecondly, I pray you conſider, That this is one motive why you ſhould rather adhere unto, and deſire a <hi>Government by Judges,</hi> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> were neerer in relation, neerer in kindred. It was not in vain that God did in the very firſt Governors that he did in mercy appoint (to govern his firſt born Son, his Church and peculiar peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple) order it ſo, that both did ſpring from one root. <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> were <hi>brethren,</hi> they were very familiar: Such God gave to the people; Which holdeth out, That God ſaw ſuch a Government to be moſt for his Glory, and the peoples good, namely, ſuch as were moſt neerly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, ſuch as were <hi>brethren,</hi> ſuch as came from a low condition: But when God was angry with the people, God appointed one of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Tribe, a mighty man, the ſon of a mighty man, in power and in wealth, to be their King, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9.1.</p>
            <p>To my apprehenſion, it is more agreeable to have <hi>Judges</hi> and <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,</hi> then <hi>Miniſters</hi> and <hi>Kings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is obſerveable, That the firſt King put to death <hi>Ahimelech the Prieſt, and all his fathers houſe, the Prieſts that were in Nob,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22.11, 16. And further, Verſ. 19. <hi>Nob, the City of the Prieſts, Saul ſmote with the ſword.</hi> Did the Judges any of them ſuch an act? And did not the Kings many of them do worſe acts? Conſider of theſe things I pray you, and the Lord give you to ſee aright.</p>
            <p>Dearly beloved <hi>Fathers,</hi> you that are the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the Lord of hoaſts, you are men that I highly eſteem of for your works ſake; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be not offended with me: I hope, in the following part of this little <hi>Treatiſe,</hi> you wil ſee cauſe not to be offended that I labor for Gods glory principally, and <hi>that Peace and Truth may meet,</hi> as <hi>Moſes and Aaron met in the Mount of God, and kiſſed each other;</hi> nor, for that I deſire that we may have <hi>Judges as at the firſt,</hi> for <hi>then ſhall we be call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a City of Righteouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now, men and brethren, you that are different in <hi>judgment,</hi> or in <hi>practice,</hi> ſuffer, I pray you, a word of <hi>Exhortation;</hi> I deſire <hi>Peace and Truth,</hi> if your deſires be the ſame, I hope we ſhall more neerly accord.

            </p>
            <p>When we conſider that happy condition in which man was created, and conſider how far we are degenerated, we may juſtly take up the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah's</hi> Lamentation, <hi>O that our eyes might be a fountain of tears, that we might weep day and night for our iniquities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is recorded in the Word of God, <hi>That all mankinde proceeded from one root;</hi> we have all one <hi>Father,</hi> and one blood runneth through all our veins; one Law of God is (or ought to be) our rule and guide: we have one and the ſame promiſes of Grace; we have one Judg that muſt judg us all; and there is but one way of good hope.

Which occaſions the Prophet to ſay, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 29.13. <hi>This people come neer to me, and honor me with their lips onely:</hi> Nay, may not I ſay, That their condition was far better then ours; for we depart far from God, (too many men do) and from his Rules preſcribed in his Law, and do behave our ſelves as if there were no God to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul us. <hi>David</hi> gives that as a brand, or mark, of a wicked man, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 12. <hi>He ſaith in his heart, Our tongues are our own, What Lord ſhall controul us?</hi> It were well (or better then it is with too many) if they were no worſe then the beaſts that periſh; for many now can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, or do not, agree ſo lovingly as the unreaſonable beaſts that ſhall periſh: Do not the wilde Bears agree amongſt themſelves? But, to leave the world in the broad way to deſtruction, I entreat you, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen, you that deſire to do Gods will, do you ſeek to be made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to that glorious image of God; <hi>Lev.</hi> 11.45. <hi>Be ye holy</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>for I am holy.

            <p>Dear Friends, amongſt the many ſins of our times, I finde, or ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſe three or four predominate corruptions, and notorious ſins, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Firſt, Contempt of the Miniſtry. Secondly, Contempt of thoſe that moſt truly fear God. And thirdly, Dividing and ſeparating one from another upon too ſlender grounds. I could reckon up many more, but theſe I onely mention at the preſent: The Devil laboreth to deceive men in thoſe things that are moſt precious, in thoſe things that may be moſt effectual to draw us from God.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, God ſaith, <hi>Do my Prophets no harm,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 6.22. And again, the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>That we ſhould have the Miniſters of God in high eſteem for their works ſake:</hi> And <hi>Nahum</hi> 1.15. <hi>Behold upon the mountains the feet of him that declareth peace,</hi> (which are the Miniſters and Embaſſadors of the moſt high God.) Thus the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> expreſſeth his eſtimation (by Gods own direction) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Miniſters: <hi>Iſai.</hi> 52.7. <hi>How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that declareth and publiſheth peace, and good tidings, and publiſheth Salvation, ſaying unto Sion, thy God reigneth?</hi> Thus <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.15. <hi>How beautiful are the feet of them that bring the glad tidings of peace, and tidings of good things?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Obſerve here, That if the feet of Gods Miniſters, which is the loweſt part of the body, and moſt ſoiled by dirt, be ſo beautiful; of what high eſtimation ought the perſon of the Miniſters to be of?</p>
            <p>It it an argument, That where we ſee men ſo abuſe and contemn the Miniſtry, that thoſe men are apt to ſlight the Word of God. If one bring us a precious Jewel, would it not be a great part of <hi>ingratitude</hi> to throw dirt and dung in his face that brought it? And obſerve well, where you ſee men ſo much abuſe, ſlight and contemn the Miniſtry, there and then, it is more then probable, God is withdrawing his gracious preſence from thoſe men. When <hi>Cam</hi> once diſcovered his fathers nakedneſs, was not he neer to a curſe? And are not <hi>Miniſters</hi> our <hi>ſpiritual Fathers?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Conſider how the <hi>Galatians</hi> behaved themſelves towards <hi>Paul</hi> their Miniſter, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.13, 14. <hi>And ye know how that through infirmity of the fleſh, I preached the Gospel unto you: Which tryal ye despiſed not, but received me as an Angel of God, yea, as Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the primitive Times of the Church, in the next Times after thoſe <hi>great perſecutions,</hi> we may read, what eſtimation and reſpect both <hi>Conſtantine</hi> and the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> yeelded and gave to the <hi>Miniſters;</hi> and ſhall we decline ſo far from the Rules of <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and from the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:117747:37"/> of <hi>the Churches</hi> in the pureſt Times?</p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>Conſider that evil words do corrupt: <hi>Doth a Fountain ſend out ſweet water and bitter? &amp;c.</hi> Remember (I pray you) <hi>That that wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom that is from above, is firſt pure, then peaceable:</hi> Look well firſt to your own hearts, and you ſhall there finde cauſe enough to bear more with thoſe things (which you conceive to be errors) in other men, but eſpecially in <hi>Miniſters.</hi> The Devil laboreth moſt to corrupt men in thoſe <hi>matters</hi> that are of the <hi>greateſt concernment:</hi> For, conſider that <hi>the Miniſtry</hi> they perſwade men to ſerve the true God in an eminent way; If therefore the Devil can but bring their Miniſtry into contempt, then the people will take but <hi>little heed</hi> to <hi>their Miniſtry.</hi> So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, if he can draw men to diſgrace thoſe that fear God, and have moſt reſpect to Gods Commandments; this is a very effectual way to draw others into thoſe ways that are oppoſite to them, that lead to certain deſtruction: Remember Chriſts <hi>caveat,</hi> Mat. 18. <hi>Take heed that you offend not one of theſe little ones, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And touching the <hi>third matter,</hi> conſider <hi>that Satan laboreth to ſow diſcord amongst brethren:</hi> for this weakens both parties, and the known Rule is to be noted <hi>[Divide and Rule,]</hi> and doubtleſs in ſuch Diviſions the Devil he ruleth too often, and too apparently.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Moſes</hi> commendeth to us an humble frame of ſpirit, and left it in his laſt Exhortation to the people, when he ſaith, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.2. <hi>My Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine ſhall drop as the rain, and my ſpeech ſhall diſtill as the dew, as the ſhowre upon the herbs, and as the great rain upon the graſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His ſpeeches were weighty, lovely and precious. Note, I pray you, how, and in what a beautiful frame and habit he bleſſeth and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to the people an humble frame of heart and ſpirit, <hi>Deut.</hi> 33.1. <hi>Now this is the bleſſing wherewith Moſes the man of God bleſſed the Children of Iſrael.</hi> Verſ. 2. <hi>The Lord came from Sinai, &amp;c.</hi> Verſ. 3. <hi>Though he love his people, yet all the Saints are in thy hands, and they are humbled at thy feet to receive thy words.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Note, I pray you, to obſerve, and lay it up as a Treaſure in your
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:117747:38"/> hearts, That God accounteth men then fit to profit, or receive Gods Word, when they are humbled at his feet, that is, when we lie moſt low, which is plainly ſhewed in theſe words, <hi>At the feet of God,</hi> which is the loweſt part, in our apprehenſions. Conſider that this grace is of great eſteem in Gods ſight: Mark upon what terms <hi>the glad tydings of Salvation</hi> are tendred, even to ſuch as were in a <hi>low condition,</hi> to ſuch as were <hi>in their blood, and no eye pityed them,</hi> to ſuch as <hi>ſee their own</hi> (not ſo much other mens) <hi>wants,</hi> to thoſe <hi>that are loſt in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25. <hi>God will teach the humble, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Countrymen, Friends, Beloved, We have many riſings of heart a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, many differences; do but obtain, and keep, and make uſe of an humble heart, and I doubt not but <hi>that peace and truth will meet,</hi> notwithſtanding all other <hi>oppoſitions:</hi> And on the contrary, ſo long as you carry in your company proud hearts, you ſhall not enjoy and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>peace and truth;</hi> the Reaſon is plain, becauſe <hi>God reſiſteth the proud, he knoweth the proud afar off:</hi> What ſaith <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.1. <hi>From whence are wars and contentions among you? are they not hence, even from your pleaſures, that fight in your members?</hi> Verſ. 2. <hi>Ye luſt, and have not; ye envy, and deſire immoderately.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall conclude this Exhortation with that <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.29. <hi>Let no cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt communication proceed out of your mouths, but that which is good to the uſe of edifying, that it may miniſter grace to the hearers.</hi> Verſ. 30. <hi>And grieve not the holy Spirit of God.</hi> Verſ. 31. <hi>Let all bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs, and anger, and wrath, and evil ſpeaking be put away, with all maliciouſneſs.</hi> Verſ, 32. <hi>Be ye courteous one to another, freely forgiving one another, even as God for Chriſts ſake freely forgave you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There hath been, or is ſtil, a great variety, diſtance and difference of opinions amongſt too many; if I ſhould or could anſwer to the ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of all, (a work much beyond my compaſs) yet new opinions ſpringing up, I ſhould ſtill have more and continued labour and trouble: Yet I ſhall propound (to the conſideration of the godly and well-affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) that way that God hath preſcribed, owned and bleſſed, for the compoſing and ending of all differences that are or ſhall ariſe.</p>
            <p>Much labour, and travel, and pains, is, and hath been taken to compoſe differences; I pray you, that you will conſider, That God, who is wiſe, and knoweth what is in man, better then man himſelf, this God brought his Church and choſen People out of <hi>Egypt</hi> through the Wilderneſs, being a Type and Figure, ſhewing us how we muſt through the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs of this world (through many temptations and tryals) paſs,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:117747:38"/> before we arrive at the Land and place of our Reſt. Many are the ſentences recorded by <hi>Moſes,</hi> (that man of God) which ſhew, That <hi>God took an especial care of his Church and Choſen:</hi> and as in other <hi>matters,</hi> (ſo eſpecially in this <hi>matter,</hi> namely, That in all caſes of differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, whether it were in the duties of men appertaining to God, in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of his Worſhip, or in ſuch differences as did ariſe or ſhould be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men, which likewiſe had a reference to the breach of Gods Law; in all of theſe caſes) God left not the people without order and means, to try, determine, and compoſe differences, for otherwiſe it had been the peoples great miſery; but <hi>God is the God of Wiſdom and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and not of Confuſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if we do conſider well of it, the way that God ordained, and owned, and bleſſed, to that end, to compoſe differences, was by appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Moſes</hi> to give Judgment in all caſes of difference, this plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, <hi>Exod.</hi> 18.15, 16. by this means all matters of difference were deſided: And ſo likewiſe the <hi>Ministers</hi> counſel was of great uſe, as appeareth, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.9, 10, 11, 12. there God doth directly command his people to ſeek counſel of the <hi>Ministers;</hi> and likewiſe doth will and command us to hearken to their counſel: The Goſpel is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that good order that God in his wiſdom preſcribed. Now, Beloved Friends, the way to compoſe differences, I beleeve, will lie much in this, namely, That we highly eſteem of the counſel of our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors <hi>temporal and ſpiritual:</hi> Government is eſtabliſhed and ſtrengthened by the Goſpel; and who can or dare preſcribe a better form (for the <hi>Adminiſtration of Justice</hi>) then God himſelf hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed and preſcribed, and never repealed?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Moſes</hi> was the firſt in <hi>Gods Ordination,</hi> and had the <hi>preeminence of matters of Judicature;</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> likewiſe had his charge and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, very nearly aſſiſtant to <hi>Moſes;</hi> the <hi>Miniſters</hi> counſel was to be of force: By <hi>Moſes</hi> all matters (whether they were breaches of the firſt or ſecond Table, whether they were matters more immediately committed againſt the Majeſty of God, or whether they were me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately committed againſt our neighbor,) all theſe matters were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined, tryed and judged by <hi>Moſes;</hi> God appointed him to judg, and to put an iſſue to all matters: The <hi>Miniſters</hi> had their place like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, their counſel was of great uſe. I purpoſe to ſpeak more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to theſe in place afterwards.</p>
            <p>This Uſe only I commend to the conſideration of all who it may concern, namely, That ſeeing that God hath given ſuch authority to
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:117747:39"/> Governors, as it is evident that God hath; for this was not cancelled or removed by the coming of our <hi>bleſſed Saviour,</hi> but contrarily this was confirmed, as ſeaſonably, I hope, will plainly appear.</p>
            <p>Conſider of that place, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.4. <hi>If then ye have judgments of things pertaining to the life, ſet them up which are leaſt esteemed in the Church, &amp;c.</hi> Was not this the way to heal their <hi>diſtempered dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences?</hi> namely, by Governors or Judges; and rather then they ſhould pretend ſome excuſe, he ſaith, <hi>Set them up which are the leaſt eſteemed, &amp;c.</hi> not that the Apoſtle intended that they ſhould ſet up any careleſly, but <hi>verſ.</hi> 5. he ſpeaks this to ſhame them.</p>
            <p>This matter being of ſuch great concernment, it behoveth us, for the good of us, and of our poſterity, to take ſpecial care, that (ſo far as it may be in our power) let us uſe all circumſpect care, That we allow of, ſet up, and obey ſuch men, as may be according to Gods mind; there lyeth much weight in it, for let our differences be what they will be, or ſhall be, or can be, yet the Governors will, they muſt, they ought to hear, try and judg of them: This is doubtleſs Gods own way, it hath his Image and Inſcription.</p>
            <p>I grant, That if any Governors, any whatever, ſhall not act for God, but againſt Gods Laws, the Body of the People, or their <hi>Repreſentatives</hi> have, or ought to have, power to depoſe and puniſh ſuch; for in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to God and his Laws, both the Governors and the governed are and ought to be ſubjects to Gods Commands.</p>
            <p>But beloved Friends, do not ſo far truſt to this your liberty, that by reaſon thereof you neglect to enquire and take counſel of God who ſhall be your Governors; have an eſpecial eye to the Rules contained in his Word, about this matter ask counſel of God: For conſider well of it, let the Experiences recorded in <hi>Scripture</hi> (let the Experiences recorded in other <hi>Nations,</hi> let our own Experiments recorded in this k nd) teach us, That when a <hi>Government</hi> is once ſetled, it is a difficult matter to remove or alter, either the perſon, or the form of <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> once eſtabliſhed, although we ſhould apparently ſee that they were evil towards God and us.</p>
            <p>We have, I believe, much cauſe to be thankful to God, That he hath granted unto us more liberty now in theſe matters, then our Fathers obtained from the days of <hi>Samuel</hi> to this day.</p>
            <p>Thoſe Governors that now we enjoy, both in the <hi>Parliament,</hi> and in the <hi>Army,</hi> (I believe) they are men that prefer <hi>Gods glory,</hi> and the <hi>Peoples good,</hi> much before any private reſpects to themſelves; and I
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:117747:39"/> do believe (if God give us patience) we ſhall ſee it evidently to appear: Let it be our wiſdom and care to know, and not to exceed the bounds of our lawful <hi>Liberties</hi> in this <hi>matter,</hi> and the Rule of God forget not.</p>
            <p>I do beſeech all you that love God, and do deſire to do his Will, That you will wreſtle with God for a bleſſing in this matter, for I believe the time is near, <hi>that God will reſtore Judges as at the firſt, and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors as at the beginning; then ſhall we be called a City of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, a faithful City,</hi> Iſai. 1.26.</p>
            <p>Touching the great difference that ſeemeth to be amongſt many, I have no doubt, but that the godly (if they obtain a bleſſing in this <hi>mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Government,</hi> and ſtudy to be quiet) ſhall plainly find a means (in Gods own way) to compoſe their differences.</p>
            <p>Dearly Beloved, You that are of different opinions, and that do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feignedly deſire to do Gods good will and pleaſure, I would put a great and vaſt difference between you, and thoſe men that manifeſt by their fruits, That the fear of God is not before their eyes, that manifeſt by their fruits, That touching Gods Commandments they agree in one opinion, which is, That they will have little reſpect to Gods Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, becauſe concerning theſe <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.2. <hi>The wicked ſpeak with a double heart;</hi> that is, they pretend that they hate diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of opinions, and that they will be comformable to Gods Laws; but alas, doth it not too evidently appear, That they acknowledg not God in all their ways; for under pretence of conformity, they ſhelter themſelves, and ſo <hi>make ready their arrows, that they may ſhoot at them which are upright in heart,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> witneſſeth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 11.2. <hi>Job</hi> ſaith (of ſuch) <hi>Job</hi> 29.17. <hi>I brake alſo the jaws of the unrighteous man, and pluckt the prey out of his teeth:</hi> And in the next Verſe <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, <hi>I was a father unto the poor; and when I knew not the cauſe, I ſought it out diligently.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To thoſe that fear the Lord, and earneſtly deſire to do his Wil, I ſay, That I believe, (that by reaſon that evil Governors have ſo chaſed, ſo afflicted, and ſo perſecuted you) that from the apprehenſions of your former miſeries you fear all <hi>Governors,</hi> you are very ſhy of <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi> But dear Friends, let me ſay this to you, Stay a while, and look back again, God hath promiſed that he will <hi>reſtore Judges as at the firſt, &amp;c.</hi> What then? then the caſe will be altered; good Governors will love the Flock, and defend them from the wicked, and ungodly, and blood-thirſty men; they will feed the Flock; God commanded
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:117747:40"/> 
               <hi>Moſes</hi> to carry the flock in his boſom, neer his heart, <hi>Numb.</hi> 11.12. <hi>Carry them in thy boſom, as a Nurſe carrieth her ſucking childe, unto the Land that I will ſhew thee:</hi> Be not afraid therefore, for a Nurſe that loveth her ſucking Childe, will love it, and not caſt it away becauſe of her own trouble, nor yet though the child have blemiſhes, and is not ſo beautiful as ſome others: I pray you be not afraid of <hi>Government,</hi> for if you eye <hi>God,</hi> &amp; enquire his counſel who ſhal govern you; fear not, follow but the rule preſcribed, and I doubt not but that God will bleſs <hi>that Government</hi> to you, <hi>the Spirit of God will reſt upon them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For conſider, <hi>That God is the Author of Government,</hi> therefore do not fly from <hi>Government;</hi> for this I can tell by experience, That I have ſeen a people that have, out of Conſcience (to my apprehenſion) profeſſedly ſeparated themſelves from other <hi>Societies</hi> in the wilderneſs, and allowed <hi>Liberty</hi> of <hi>Conſcience</hi> without any diſturbance: I have ſeen, and noted, and experimentally known theſe people and paſſages, and what have been the <hi>fruits</hi> of ſuch a boundleſs, monſtrous and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed <hi>Liberty:</hi> They have rent and divided ſo amongſt themſelves, that it hath come to open hatred one of another, and they have even cryed out for to have ſome <hi>Government, that men might not ſpeak and do what they liſt.</hi> For conſider of it, <hi>That when God doth withdraw his good Spirit from men, and let the Devil looſe to deceive them, it is ſcarcely credible to beleeve how far ſuch men are drawn away, even to blaspheme God and his ſacred Word,</hi> (which are unſeparable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions;) And ſome may be drawn to beleeve, <hi>That they may murther their Neighbors, and take their Wives, Children, or Goods.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now conſider, <hi>That it is a ſingular and precious mercy to us, that God hath wiſely and ſtrongly preſcribed Rules, and Bounds, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, to theſe raging waves of the reſtleſs Sea, beyond which they may not paſs.</hi> Dear Friends, Look upon <hi>Government</hi> as a preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous mercy; it were not to be expreſſed, the greatneſs of our miſery to be without Governors; or to be without the bleſſed Laws of God to be governed by. For conſider it well, <hi>That as the Laws of God are for Gods glory, ſo likewiſe the Laws of God are for our exceeding great good:</hi> There is no Law of God but our Good is contained in it; and without thoſe Laws we ſhould be miſerable: The wicked of the world would diſhonor God that made us, and they would make ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and vaſſals of us: The ſtrong would oppreſs the weak, and would devour another.</p>
            <pb n="77" facs="tcp:117747:40"/>
            <p>Note well all along from <hi>Moſes</hi> to <hi>Samuel,</hi> and you ſhall finde, <hi>That when the condition of the People was in a ſtate of ſuch a Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to be without chief Governors, then the people committed wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and are puniſhed: and the way that God delivered them was by raiſing up good Governors.</hi> For <hi>this</hi> take for an aſſured <hi>truth, That from good Gouernors and good Laws ariſeth bleſſedneſs:</hi> Therefore cleave cloſe to the Laws of God, they are a <hi>precious treaſure:</hi> And likewiſe, take heed that your Governors be of Gods ſending: Follow the Rules by God preſcribed, exactly, diligently.</p>
            <p>There are ſome books written by ſome that I forbear to name, (both becauſe the matter ſeemeth to me to be ended, and alſo becauſe I fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low after peace) I will not meddle with the Cauſe they or he pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that moved him to write: But this I ſay, They, or he, have not cauſe to complain of unkindneſs from this <hi>preſent Government,</hi> for he hath <hi>juſt cauſe</hi> to ſay, <hi>they were patient and forbearing;</hi> for I deſire thoſe who are guilty to conſider in what an high degree they have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. The Holy Ghoſt commandeth us, <hi>That no corrupt communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhould proceed out of our mouths:</hi> and the Apoſtle <hi>Jude</hi> ſheweth <hi>the great evil</hi> of thoſe that are <hi>hold in their own conceits:</hi> I deſire God to give them <hi>repentance</hi> if it be poſſible, That <hi>the thoughts</hi> of <hi>their hearts</hi> (and <hi>their tranſcendent evil</hi>) may be forgiven to them: For conſider, That (let men ſlatter what they will or can) yet there is a glorious God, whoſe eyes are as a flame of fire, from his ſight <hi>ſuch deeds</hi> of <hi>darkneſs</hi> cannot be hidden; and remember, <hi>That God is a jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There was a <hi>great ado, a great tumult,</hi> but (I beleeve) <hi>the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part</hi> know not what they would have done.</p>
            <p>Some cry out againſt <hi>the Government,</hi> who if they well conſider of it, they know not their own hearts: For <hi>this</hi> I do beleeve, Let them have what Government they deſire, yet they would ſtill finde ſome <hi>matter</hi> to be <hi>diſcontent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beloved Country men, <hi>A great part</hi> of <hi>England</hi> ſurfet with <hi>pride and wantonneſs:</hi> Take heed, God hath many ways to abate our <hi>pride</hi> and to humble us: Do we not forget the <hi>great mercy</hi> of God, in giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us his holy and ſacred Word in our own Language? Do we not forget that other places worſhip Idols, and have <hi>their Inquiſition houſes,</hi> where many <hi>ſad hearts</hi> do not behold the light of either Sun or Moon. I do verily beleeve, if ſome men were in other Countries, and ſhould
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:117747:41"/> ſpeak but the hundred part of what they ſay here, they ſhould then know <hi>the difference</hi> of <hi>Government.</hi> But if ſome do ſpeak what they liſt, (as if there were no God) yet let us all lay it to heart, <hi>there is a righteous God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now I deſire, without offence, to propound to them that are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the Aſſemblies, namely, <hi>Whether that now in theſe times, wherein the Government are deſirous and do endeavor a Reformation, firſt, ought not there to be in all good Chriſtians a readineſs and will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingneſs (and not a backwardneſs and unwillingneſs) to joyn in (and to help forward) this work?</hi> It is recorded for out Learning, <hi>Judg.</hi> 5.15. <hi>That for the Diviſion of Reuben there were great thoughts of heart.</hi> It is noted, That when the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> for the ſin and obſtinacy of the <hi>Benjamites,</hi> deſtroyed <hi>their City,</hi> when <hi>the matter</hi> was over, how did they lament for <hi>their Brethren!</hi> They had no pleaſure that a Tribe ſhould be cut off from the Church of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> Read <hi>Judges</hi> 21.2. <hi>And the People came unto the houſe of God, and abode there till even before God, and lift up their voyces and wept with great lamentation.</hi> Verſ. 3. <hi>And ſaid, O Lord God of Iſrael, why is this come to paſs in Iſrael, that this day one Tribe of Iſrael ſhould want?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We may ſee here what a loving and godly <hi>frame of ſpirit</hi> was in this people; They were ſo far off from rejoycing, that there was likely to be <hi>a Tribe ſeparated from Iſrael,</hi> that they do conſult, and conſider, and uſe means, <hi>That this Tribe may not wholy be cut off.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O that I could evidently (now in <hi>theſe times of Liberty and oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities</hi>) ſee ſuch <hi>a frame of ſpirit:</hi> But alaſs! doth it not on the contrary appear, That here are now but a few <hi>wet eye,</hi> but <hi>little lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,</hi> for <hi>the differences that are ſo great, and ſo many?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Dear Friends, On all hands lay it to <hi>heart,</hi> and be humbled for it, <hi>That there is no neerer affinity in your affections:</hi> Do you expect on all hands, that you are not to move forwards, towards this uniting in brotherly fellowſhip, till you be ſent to, or till you be drawn to it with ſtrong bands? I pray you conſider, <hi>Is not our union by faith in Jeſus Chriſt as neer a relation as any bond or tye that Iſrael had? Is not Chriſts Precepts, and Exhortations, and Commands, as preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and as evident, and as ſtrong, to perſwade us to unity and a clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in brotherly fellowſhip now under the Gospel, as before under the Law?</hi> Doth not Chriſt ſay, <hi>A new Commandment I give unto you, That you love one another?</hi> Doth not Chriſt tell us, <hi>That if we forgive not men their Treſpaſſes, neither will our heavenly Father
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:117747:41"/> forgive us our Treſpaſſe?</hi> who was <hi>the Samaritans Neighbour?</hi> was it not <hi>hee that bound up his wounds?</hi> Luke 10.30. Doth not the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles tell us, <hi>That if we had faith to remove Mountaines, yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out love it profitteth us nothing:</hi> The Apoſtle asketh this queſtion, <hi>hee that loveth not his Brother that hee hath ſeene, how ſhall that man love God that he hath not ſeene?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſtand not in ſuch <hi>knowne truths</hi> to particularize <hi>Chapters</hi> and <hi>Verſes:</hi> where can you read the <hi>Doctrine of Chriſt,</hi> or of <hi>his Apoſtles,</hi> where <hi>theſe matters</hi> are not evident to be ſeen?</p>
            <p>Beloved friends, may I not ſay with the Apoſtle, <hi>that I am afraid of you: that your hearts are not right in the preſence of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But you will ſay unto me, <hi>what would you have us to do? are there not many lets in the way to hinder us from reaching out the right hand of fellowſhip to our Brethren or Neighbours,</hi> (for ſome will not allow of the brotherhood) <hi>are there not many ſinfull practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and much diſorder?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Is there not a wiſe man amongſt you, to heale and to make up theſe breaches? Let mee propound this to your conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, doe but remove one poyſonous weede out of your hearts, and inſteed thereof plant two ſweete ſmelling Herbes, and meete when you will, I ſhould not doubt, (by Gods aſſiſtance) but that all other differences may eaſily be compoſed, ſo that you may joyne toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in brotherly fellowſhip, a great many of you that now ſtand at diſtance.</p>
            <p>The poyſonous weede to be removed is <hi>Pride,</hi> pluck up that by the roots.</p>
            <p>The graces or herbes to be planted in the ſteed thereof, are <hi>Love one to another, and Humility;</hi> be ſure theſe be ſafely preſerved: in giving honor go one before another: Friends or Countrymen, you ſtumble at ſome failings, but doe you not (in the meane time) leap over Mountaines, and plung your ſelves into dangerous places? It was the very leaven <hi>Chriſt</hi> reproved in <hi>the Scribes and Phariſces,</hi> they <hi>tithed mint and anniſe, and at the ſame time were guilty of the breach of the Law of God, in weighty matters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You are loth to cloſe, leſt you ſhould hould <hi>communion with ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners?</hi> It may be ſo, but conſider well, That <hi>that heavenly wiſdome that is from above, is firſt pure:</hi> Let us ſearch well our own hearts, let us try them well, and (I doe believe) we ſhall ſee as many and as great ſinnes there, as wee doe ſee in many of thoſe with whom
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:117747:42"/> we will not cloſe becauſe they are ſinners; Remember, forget not what condition we were in <hi>when Chriſt layeth downe his life, and ſheddeth out his precious blood for us?</hi> were we not then all over from head to heele defiled in our bloud? And did then Chriſt reach out <hi>the right hand of his fellowſhip to us?</hi> and are wee ſo ſhy one of another? Chriſt wiſheth us <hi>to be mercifull as our heavenly Father is mercifull.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Dearely beloved Countrey men, I muſt forbeare, times quick mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion bids mee go on. I pray you yet that I may propound to your conſideration, <hi>whether Reformation bee not now more meete, and more agreeable to the ſacred Scriptures,</hi> (now in <hi>this time of liberty,</hi> and when wee may have <hi>the strength of authority</hi> to helpe us) <hi>then ſeparation, in ſuch a manner, as that wee ſeeke nor greatly the love, fellowſhip, or communion of many, more then we now doe.</hi> I propound it in as eaſie termes as I can.</p>
            <p>For the unfoulding of this matter I conceive it neceſſary, for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition, to propound the objection that may afterward ariſe in the chiefe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> Jer. 15.9. <hi>If thou take away the precious from the vile, thou ſhalt be as my mouth, let them returne unto thee, but returne not unto them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> In ſuch <hi>matters</hi> as wee finde recorded in holy <hi>Scriptures</hi> that leads us to extraordinary duties, or to ſuch practiſes as are not uſually followed <hi>in other places of Scriptures</hi> (being conſtrued or underſtood, in <hi>the ſevereſt interpretation</hi>) for otherwayes (being favourable taken, conſonant to the continued practice and preſidents of the Prophets, Chriſt, and his Apoſtles,) there will not in my apprehenſion) be any <hi>matter of moment</hi> to hinder communion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene many that now are divided: I hold it a lafe way to have recourſe to other and in ore plainer; laces of <hi>Scripture,</hi> which ſhew us how theſe darker places are to bee underſtood, conſtrued, and practiſed.</p>
            <p>I believe the Prophet <hi>Ieremy</hi> (directed by God) ſought to draw and win the godly in his time, from thoſe ſinnes that the People (many of them) then lived in; ſo that they might not partake with the wicked in thoſe evils, which God had forbidden: and in this ſence he enviteth the godly <hi>not to returne to the abhomination of the wicked, but let them returne to thee,</hi> that is to ſay, let them returne to thee, and then in thoſe things that God inſtituted in Gods
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:117747:42"/> Ordinances thou mayſt joyne with them; but note I pray you, <hi>That the People were not hereby exhorted to devide in the Paſſover, nor in any of Gods own Ordinances;</hi> for then I conceive it had beene vaine for the Prophet to have left that door open, <hi>that the wicked might have forſaken his evils and have returned to them, if upon their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, the godly had ſtood at a diſtance in houlding fellowſhip in Gods own inſtitutions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the queſtion now were, <hi>Whether it be lawfull for Believers to joyne with other</hi> (though believers) <hi>in the commiſſion of ſinne;</hi> it might eaſily be iſſued for it is cleare, <hi>wee may not breake Gods Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now I conceive the caſe may be otherwiſe conſidered of, for it is deſired <hi>that there may bee fellowſhip in thoſe things, which both parties acknowledge to be Gods owne Ordinances,</hi> as in <hi>the celebrating the Sacrament, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is to bee well conſidered that many times <hi>the ſtate of the Iewiſh Church was much corrupted,</hi> many <hi>corruptions</hi> there were, and yet the Prophets did in thoſe times joyne with the people, in theſe Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances that <hi>God</hi> had inſtituted, as namely <hi>the Paſſover, Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, &amp;c.</hi> but not in their ſinnes. The People in the time of <hi>Elijah</hi> were fallen fouly, he joyned not therefore with them in their ſins; but <hi>when the People were preſent hee offereth Sacrifice,</hi> 1 Kings 18. and upon <hi>the Peoples acknowledgement of God,</hi> hee then joyneth with the People in doing <hi>Gods Will,</hi> namely <hi>in ſtaying Baalls Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet.</hi> The People of the <hi>Iewes</hi> in the time of our Saviour were very ſinfull, Chriſt doth not ſpeake with them in ſinning; but in Gods owne Ordinances hee joyned with the People, or did celebrate with them the <hi>Paſſover,</hi> and ſo did the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> joyne in <hi>the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebration of the Paſſover,</hi> and in <hi>the obſervation of circumciſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The height of my perſwaſions reach no further then to this effect, namely, <hi>that there might be a Brotherly cloſing, and the right hand of fellowſhip in thoſe things that are of God, and ſo acknowledged by both parties.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Friends there are many Lions in the way to hinder your cloſing, but this I believe, <hi>that if there were unfeigned love, and ſound hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility in many of your ſoules, there would bee great ſorrow in your hearts, for the diviſions of Reuben, and</hi> alſo an attempt, (meanes would bee uſed) to joyne together in <hi>Brotherly fellowſhip:</hi> now that there are ſo <hi>faire opportunities,</hi> as to my apprehenſions there are to be reconciled.</p>
            <pb n="82" facs="tcp:117747:43"/>
            <p>But I ſpeake it with griefe, I ſee but little meanes uſed, do not <hi>Chriſtians, Acquaintance, and Friends,</hi> carry themſelves as if there were no <hi>great matters</hi> in it, whether former breaches be healed or no?</p>
            <p>Note and conſider well of the Apoſtles words recorded <hi>Philip.</hi> 3.15. <hi>Let us therefore as many as be perfect be thus minded, and if any be otherwiſe minded God ſhall rev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Conſider of it upon all hands, there is much evil ſomewhere, the mouthes of the wicked are much opened by reaſon of our diviſions, and <hi>the hearts</hi> of the <hi>Godly Miniſters</hi> much grieved, and our <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> much weakened, and diſturbed, by the many diviſions that are amongſt us; conſider it, looke to it, for <hi>the many precepts, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidents, exhortations, and invitations, that are recorded in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, will not be as water ſpilt upon the ground,</hi> but they ſhall ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prevaile in our hearts, and ſhew themſelves in our fruits, or elſe it had beene better for many that they had never knowne <hi>ſuch precious directions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have many or diverſe examples, in <hi>the Scripture</hi> recorded for our learning which ſpeake of <hi>Reformation of Churches,</hi> but not one (that I know of) that ſheweth a <hi>willfull and contented ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Believers from Believers,</hi> in thoſe things agreed on, to be <hi>Gods owne Inſtitutions</hi> being conſidered in a generall way, <hi>whole Churches.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is an apparent difference between <hi>that ſeparation,</hi> when the Church caſteth out a ſinner (for ſome offence obſtinately continued in) wherein wee may note, <hi>that the perſon offending, is a paſſive, and not an active, in the matter of his excluſion;</hi> hee doth not vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily exclude the Church, but the Church him: and alſo during the time of his <hi>ſeparation</hi> hee is not to be counted as an <hi>enemy,</hi> or <hi>unbeliever,</hi> but admoniſhed as a <hi>Brother:</hi> and betweene <hi>this ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> ſo much now practiſed, is it not <hi>a willfull or contented ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration,</hi> whereby, many ſtand at a <hi>manifeſt and great diſtance from
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:117747:43"/> Believers and Churches, that are willing to be at peace and unity with them?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhould deſire all men that willingly ſeparate to conſider, <hi>that their is a great difference, betweene, partaking in ſinne, &amp; partaking in thoſe duties, which God hath preſcribed.</hi> And that ſuppoſe that there be blemiſhes or ſome things wherein wee conceive there is ſinne, if we according to rule do proceede therein, ſo far as our places do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, we may then live in ſome ſocieties, wherein ſome may remain, and not excluded, which wee count ſinners.</p>
            <p>I conceive Chriſt his example is evident and cleare in <hi>this matter,</hi> who continued <hi>his fellowſhip in the Church of the Iewes, in Gods Ordinances,</hi> and nevertheleſſe did not <hi>partake with them in their ſinnes.</hi>

            <p>But ſecondly, I deſire that we may duly and well conſider, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in conſiſteth, whereupon dependeth, and from what roote ariſeth, and what is the cauſe, that God hath granted <hi>this precious favour to us, that are by nature Gentiles, &amp;c.</hi> that <hi>wee ſhall bee his children; of his houſehould, and have brotherly fellowſhip:</hi> doth it ariſe from any <hi>inherent righteouſneſſe</hi> in us, more then in others? Or from any <hi>actuall holineſſe</hi> in us? or doth it not ariſe from a <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to us? we are called <hi>Saints,</hi> not becauſe <hi>wee of our ſelves are more righteous then others,</hi> but becauſe <hi>wee believing the promiſes of God, Chriſt his righteouſneſſe is imputed to us;</hi> this is the roote and cauſe of our <hi>fellowſhip and brotherhood.</hi> Thus it is recorded, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.21, 22, 23, <hi>for there is no difference, for all have ſinned and are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of the glory of God.</hi> ver. 24. <hi>and are juſtified freely by his grace, through the Redemption that is in Christ Ieſus.</hi> verſ. 25, 26, 27, 28. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.4. <hi>being justified by Faith wee have peace towards God thorough our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, &amp;c.</hi> Gal 2.16. <hi>from this roote wee are ſaid to bee ingrafted and united unto Chriſt by Faith;</hi> This is the true cauſe of our <hi>brotherly fellowſhip.</hi> Suppoſe that <hi>ten men bee the brethren of one Father,</hi> it is not a ſufficient cauſe to diſſolve <hi>their bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therhood,</hi> becauſe that one <hi>wanteth an eye,</hi> another <hi>a hand,</hi> and another <hi>is blemiſhed,</hi> and not ſo <hi>beautifull.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But thirdly, conſider wee all of us, how far, and in what manner we are polluted and defiled with ſinnes our owne ſelves, and by that meanes, we ſhall not ſo eaſily ſeparate <hi>the bonds of Brotherly fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip:</hi> becauſe we ſee <hi>that others are ſinners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I beſeech you that mourne for <hi>the breaches that are in the Iſrael of
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:117747:44"/> God,</hi> uſe <hi>diligence,</hi> follow after <hi>Peace,</hi> go to other <hi>ſocieties,</hi> and ſhew <hi>that you are deſirous, to repaire and make up the breaches that have beene and are;</hi> ſhew your <hi>grievances</hi> what they are, I am perſwaded <hi>the Godly Miniſters,</hi> and many people, will meete you and be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to remove <hi>any juſt cauſe of offence</hi> and to doe <hi>any lawfull act, or acts,</hi> for the reuniting, and for the obtaining of <hi>Peace,</hi> and of <hi>Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly fellowſhip:</hi> but deare friends, bee ſure before you come, <hi>pull pride out of your hearts by the rootes,</hi> and inſteed thereof <hi>labour to plant and bring love and humility,</hi> and then I dare undertake a <hi>recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I pray you give me leave (without offence) to propound to your conſideration, an inſtance or two, which I can be experience wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. There is a place where the <hi>Governor and Miniſters</hi> were god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: they out of zeale did ſeparate wholy and with ſome few others did joyne together in <hi>Covenant or fellowſhip:</hi> and did at once refuſe to joyne with all other in <hi>Gods owne Ordinances,</hi> as namely in <hi>the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebration of the Sacrament and Baptiſme, &amp;c.</hi> What followed? whereas before the whole place was (in my apprehenſion) in a hopefull way of <hi>Reformation,</hi> and turning from evill to good; the <hi>Miniſters</hi> were generally beloved, and ſo was <hi>the Governour,</hi> by the moſt of the <hi>inhabitants,</hi> till this time of <hi>their totall ſeparation;</hi> but afterwards, thoſe that ſaw not light for ſuch a practice, firſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew <hi>their affections</hi> from <hi>the Miniſters,</hi> and from <hi>the Governor,</hi> and ſtill the flame increaſed till <hi>the Governors and Ministers,</hi> were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed, and worſe (in regard of godlineſſe) obtained their places, and that place now is become more evill, then before, and leſſe hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
            <p>Might not <hi>theſe godly Miniſters,</hi> and <hi>Governor,</hi> have reformed all the evills, as well in a way of <hi>Reformation,</hi> as in a way of rigid and ſudden <hi>totall ſeparation?</hi> which if they had orderly proceeded in, and ſo have dealt with ſuch as had been known ſinners according to any cleare rule, and by juſt proces have excluded every known, Obſtinate, and unrepentant ſinner; this I believe would have bin bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ne by <hi>the People,</hi> and the <hi>Miniſters</hi> and <hi>Governor</hi> might (I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve) have ſtill remained in their places, and might ſtill have bin beloved <hi>of the People,</hi> and they might (I believe) have done the ſame (in effect) by a way of <hi>Reformation,</hi> that they endeavored to do in a way of <hi>totall ſeparation,</hi> which brought ſuch ſad events.</p>
            <p>I could inſtance in another People <hi>ſome matters</hi> tending to the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:117747:44"/> ſame effect, in both which I have noted with diligence the fruits, and I cannot ſee <hi>the gracious preſence of God to ſucceede ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore I deſire all who it may concerne warilie to conſider <hi>the fruits of ſeparation,</hi> where we may do the <hi>ſame matters,</hi> in a way of <hi>Reformation.</hi> And further conſider <hi>that it is a more facile way to ſeparate from other ſinners, then to ſeparate from the ſinnes of our owne hearts.</hi> God forgiveth us every day our ſins, and yet how ſharply do we proceed againſt <hi>our brethren.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>matter</hi> requireth that much more ſhould be ſpoken to it, but I forbear becauſe I fear to offend any of <hi>Chriſts little ones.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have only endeavoured to remove <hi>thoſe hinderances</hi> which I conceive do chiefly hinder <hi>Peace and Truth</hi> from meeting and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing.</p>
            <p>Now dearely beloved <hi>Fathers,</hi> you into whoſe hands God hath committed, <hi>the Government of this Common-wealth,</hi> and <hi>the People,</hi> and <hi>the affaires</hi> thereof; <hi>I</hi> humbly deſire that you will not be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that I do propound to your godly conſideration the few fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing lines contained in <hi>this little Treatiſe;</hi> I pray you do not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine to look over (and conſider) what is in them contained, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>instrument</hi> that offereth them to you is but weake and meane. Conſider <hi>that God ſometimes chuſeth weake, and meane in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, to bring about his owne purpoſes:</hi> It was a <hi>great Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> that the <hi>great men</hi> and <hi>learned Doctors</hi> uſed (in the time of our <hi>Saviour</hi>) to bring <hi>his Doctrine,</hi> and <hi>the Doctrine of his Apoſtles</hi> into contempt, namely they ſaid, <hi>is not this the Carpenters Sonne? are not theſe unlearned men, poore Fiſhermen?</hi> and the like; I hope this ſhall not be a <hi>prevalent Argument</hi> with you, to cauſe you to deſpiſe what I here offer to your conſideration; deſpiſe not altogether <hi>the day of ſmall things:</hi> I have not that rich ſtore of (neither do I much ſeek for) thoſe rich garments of the ſentences drawn out of many other <hi>Writers,</hi> to caſt over and to adorne <hi>this little Treatiſe,</hi> to make it appeare beautifull, I muſt preſent it to you in the plaine <hi>ſimplicity of the Goſpell.</hi> The <hi>authority</hi> (I ſhall alledge) is drawn only or chiefly from the <hi>Word of God,</hi> which I ſhall endeavour to tender to you (ſo far as God ſhall aſſiſt me) without <hi>addition</hi> or <hi>diminution,</hi> not turning to either hand.</p>
            <p>Through much <hi>difficult tryalls and temptations,</hi> I have bin helped
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:117747:45"/> (I believe by <hi>God his good Spirit</hi>) to obtaine this benefit that I might tender <hi>theſe things</hi> to your <hi>conſideration;</hi> and as you are more eminently conſidered in them, yet I alſo and my poſterity and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of my friends are likewiſe trulie concerned in theſe following lines. I confeſſe they are but as a mite, yet I pray you accept them, and lay them up, let them be put into <hi>the treaſury of your hearts,</hi> to be conſidered of.</p>
            <p>Dearly beloved Fathers I pray you accept favorably of <hi>theſe few following lines,</hi> wherein I have laboured to preſent to <hi>your godly conſiderations, ſuch a platforme,</hi> or <hi>draught of Government,</hi> as is drawn from (or out of) <hi>the unblemiſhed and moſt perfect patterne,</hi> preſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and revealed in <hi>the ſacred Scripture,</hi> thoſe ſtreight and unerring <hi>rules of truth:</hi> in the <hi>diſcription</hi> thereof I have endeavoured, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out adding or diminiſhing, (according to <hi>the meaſure of Grace and ſtrength from God</hi> received) to preſent it to you with <hi>faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe <hi>reaſons</hi> following have moved me to preſent <hi>theſe following lines</hi> to your <hi>conſiderations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>aiming at Gods Glory:</hi> having an eſpeciall reſpect to <hi>the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of thoſe precious promiſes,</hi> foretold by <hi>the Prophets.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>becauſe that I my ſelfe and my poſterity are concerned in the cauſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>becauſe that ſuch an opportunity</hi> (I believe) <hi>hath not beene offered from the dayes of Samuel to this time,</hi> conſidering I look upon you <hi>as men that aime principally at the glory of God,</hi> and not ſo much at any <hi>worldly reſpects,</hi> yon knowing and ſeeing <hi>the brittleneſſe, the uncertainty, the mutability,</hi> and <hi>vanity</hi> that is to be attained in any <hi>worldly comforts,</hi> compared with <hi>thoſe true, weighty, precious trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,</hi> provided, promiſed, and reſerved, for <hi>all thoſe that love God, believe in him, and do unfeinedly deſire to doe his Will and Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, I do conſider <hi>that your actings now, and the platforme of Government that you are now conſidering of, is ſuch as is like to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne poſterity.</hi> It will concerne <hi>England, Ireland, Scotland,</hi> and our <hi>Neighbour Nations,</hi> they will warily look upon it, and it will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the <hi>Iſlands</hi> in the <hi>Indies, Barmoedas, Virginia, New England, Newfound Land,</hi> and other places.</p>
            <p>Conſider therefore, I pray you, with the <hi>greatest reſpect,</hi> that <hi>you have an eye to the patterne of the Sanctuary, to thoſe rules, and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:117747:45"/> preſidents recorded in Gods revealed Will the holy Scriptures,</hi> I pray you <hi>turne not to the right hand,</hi> nor <hi>to the left hand,</hi> remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber what an expreſſe charge God gave to <hi>Ioſhua:</hi> Chap. 1.8. <hi>Let not this Booke of the Law depart out of thy mouth, but meditate therein day and night, that thou mayeſt obſerve and do according to all that is written therein, for then ſhalt thou make thy way proſperous, and then ſhalt thou have good ſucceſſe.</hi> I beſeech you <hi>deare Fathers</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult not too much with <hi>fleſh and blood,</hi> follow not the many and uncertaine <hi>preſidents and inventions of men.</hi> If you keepe cloſe to <hi>Gods Rule,</hi> you ſhall not err, you ſhall be ſafe, and then ſhall I and my poſterity (ſome of your little children), ſhroud our ſelves, under the <hi>protection of your wing,</hi> with more peace and comfort, concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving our ſelves by <hi>Gods Providence,</hi> to be ſecured from the many <hi>Wolves,</hi> and <hi>Beares,</hi> and <hi>Lyons, that lie in waite to hurt us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have travelled through <hi>many difficulties,</hi> forſaken <hi>Wife, Children,</hi> and ſome <hi>worldly comforts,</hi> that <hi>J</hi> might preſent <hi>theſe following lines</hi> to your <hi>conſiderations,</hi> (which <hi>I</hi> would not mention but to this end,) <hi>That it might take ſome impreſſion in your hearts, and cauſe you adviſedly to read and to conſider what is contained in theſe follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lines, and that</hi> ſo <hi>all my labour</hi> may not be loſt, and <hi>theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> caſt aſide as waſt paper, to that end <hi>I</hi> pray you not to looke ſo much at <hi>the Garment</hi> as at <hi>the ſubſtance,</hi> and not ſo much at <hi>the Order,</hi> or <hi>Forme,</hi> as at <hi>the Truth</hi> and <hi>true Meaning,</hi> of what <hi>J</hi> have tendred to you: but whatever <hi>my ſucceſſe</hi> ſhall be, <hi>I</hi> know <hi>my depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dancy,</hi> and <hi>whom I have truſted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Dearely beloved <hi>Fathers, J</hi> meane not to exclude <hi>my requeſts</hi> from being preſented (and are intended by me) to be tendered to <hi>thoſe two worthy Servants of God,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax,</hi> and Sir <hi>Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Cromwell,</hi> being <hi>Fathers of this Common-wealth in an eminent manner.</hi> To <hi>them</hi> and to <hi>the reſt of thoſe worthy Governours of this Common-wealth,</hi> to <hi>you all,</hi> I preſent <hi>my requeſts</hi> and what ſhall be contained in <hi>theſe following lines.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Dearely beloved <hi>Fathers:</hi> you have now a <hi>great, and glorious, or precious opportunity</hi> put into your hands of <hi>Reformation,</hi> be but <hi>Faithfull in this,</hi> and God will make you <hi>Rulers of more and greater Cities;</hi> of <hi>Heavenly places.</hi> In the meane time, till you can ſettle <hi>Government</hi> according to your deſire, <hi>I</hi> pray you let <hi>the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Juſtice</hi> come thorough as few hands as with <hi>equity</hi> you may, that ſo <hi>the poore</hi> may come at <hi>their right,</hi> with as <hi>little difficulty,</hi>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:117747:46"/> or <hi>charge,</hi> and with as <hi>much eaſe,</hi> as may be, which (<hi>I</hi> do believe) you do endeavour.</p>
            <p>I humble requeſt of you likewiſe, <hi>that you will take off from the Common-wealth what burdens and taxations, you can. I</hi> pray you be deeply and thoroughly affected, with the many <hi>ſad complaints,</hi> and <hi>ſighs</hi> of many <hi>poore hearts,</hi> that are under your <hi>Government,</hi> that are of your <hi>flock,</hi> remember what <hi>frame of ſpirit</hi> was in that firſt, and godly, and eminent <hi>patterne of piety,</hi> namely, in holy and humble <hi>Moſes,</hi> that <hi>bleſſed man of God,</hi> he ſought <hi>the good, the eaſe,</hi> and <hi>the comfort of that people God committed to his government,</hi> he changed <hi>this tranſitory life,</hi> and now lives <hi>with God,</hi> and <hi>with his bleſſed Angells to eternity,</hi> the memory of him is recorded (for our lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning) in <hi>Gods Booke of Records,</hi> and is precious, and bleſſed in all Ages.</p>
            <p>Remember how our <hi>bleſſed Saviour</hi> delivered us from <hi>thoſe op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of ſinnes,</hi> and from <hi>Satan</hi> and from <hi>Death,</hi> and laid downe <hi>his life</hi> to redeeme us; and <hi>all this hee did freely for us,</hi> when <hi>no eye pittied us,</hi> yea even then when <hi>wee were at emnity with him,</hi> and he was a <hi>precious patterne</hi> for us to imitate, and now <hi>hee ſitteth in glory,</hi> and is <hi>bleſſed to all eternity.</hi> Hee regarded not, the momentary trifles, of <hi>worldly wealth,</hi> the <hi>Foxes had holes, and the Birds of the Aire had neſts, but the Sonne of man had ſcarcely a place whereon to reſt his Head; bee mercifull becauſe your Heavenly Father is mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I do believe you do earneſtly deſire, and endeavour to take off from <hi>the people</hi> what <hi>burdens</hi> you can, <hi>J</hi> do conſider that you have very many and great <hi>engagements,</hi> that for the preſent you cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voide <hi>Taxations,</hi> but <hi>I</hi> hope <hi>thoſe occaſions</hi> will in time convenient be removed, ſo that then <hi>I</hi> hope you will eaſe <hi>the people</hi> what poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly you can. (<hi>I</hi> hope God will ſhew you a way to do it:) of this <hi>I</hi> am perſwaded that we might be more eaſed in <hi>this matter,</hi> were it not for the <hi>gainſayings</hi> and <hi>moleſtations,</hi> that diverſe bring upon us by reaſon of <hi>their irregularities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I pray you be mindefull of our <hi>Trading</hi> and <hi>Marchandize,</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage <hi>that,</hi> that ſo the <hi>poore labourer</hi> may bee imployed, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved.</p>
            <p>I cannot but with thankefulneſſe acknowledge your <hi>great care,</hi> and <hi>charge</hi> that you have allready taken, in ſetting out Ships, to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure our <hi>Marchants</hi> at Sea; <hi>I</hi> pray you ſtill continue your <hi>watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:117747:46"/> that way</hi> becauſe <hi>theſe times,</hi> are <hi>times</hi> wherein many <hi>ungodly men, bloud thirſty,</hi> and <hi>deceitful men,</hi> lie in waite, to <hi>devour the labours,</hi> and <hi>the perſons, of many honeſt and well minded men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I pray you to encourage <hi>the Souldiers,</hi> by allowing unto them ſuch a <hi>competent maintenance,</hi> that they may comfortably live, for otherwiſe it will occaſion them to rob or ſteal, whereby <hi>our lives</hi> and <hi>our eſtates</hi> ſhall be more damaged, and endangered. I hope that God will give un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us <hi>your people</hi> ſuch <hi>ſeeing eyes,</hi> ſuch <hi>willing and cheerefull confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,</hi> ſuch <hi>wholeſome, and peaceable,</hi> and <hi>well ordered tongues,</hi> ſuch a freeneſſe <hi>of heart to acknowledge, and be thankefull for all your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer faithfullneſſe, and your great labours of love towards us,</hi> that we ſhall have ſuch a <hi>loving agreement,</hi> and ſuch <hi>a generall peace and bleſſedneſſe,</hi> that you may free us from many of our <hi>military men,</hi> and they may with honor, and comfort, and a bleſſing from God, and from you, and from us all, return to their own homes with peace and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</p>
            <p>I humbly deſire you to have a <hi>favorable respect,</hi> to thoſe that ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from us, and to thoſe that are different from us in ſome particulars in <hi>their judgements,</hi> out of <hi>tenderneſſe of conſcience,</hi> ſo long as they <hi>lead a godly, a peaceable and a quiet life.</hi> Conſider I pray you <hi>that ſuch fear and love God, and deſire to do that which is well pleaſing in Gods ſight,</hi> and fearing to offend and provoke God, or to break his <hi>Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> they do abſtain or refrain from doing ſome things which they have <hi>liberty</hi> to do: conſider <hi>that the ſinnes or offences of ſuch perſons, are uſually in the matters of omiſſion.</hi> God did not command in the Law (ſo far as I underſtand) <hi>that men ſhould,</hi> (I meane thoſe that were <hi>Gentiles by nature) be compelled to partake either of the Paſſover, or Circumciſion,</hi> nor <hi>to adhere to the Church of the true Iſrael of God by way of ſpirituall fellowſhip.</hi> Moreover have not <hi>theſe men</hi> notwithſtanding (I mean <hi>Believers,</hi> though they fear to joyn in <hi>fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with other Believers</hi> for fear of offending God thereby) <hi>the marke or character of Gods ſervants?</hi> See 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 17.39. <hi>Nehe.</hi> 1.11. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.15. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.14. <hi>&amp;</hi> 34.9. <hi>&amp;</hi> 103.11. <hi>Hee hath not dealt with us after our ſinnes: neither rewarded us after our iniquities.</hi> Ver. 11. <hi>For as the Heaven is high above the Earth, ſo great is his mercy towards them that feare him.</hi> Ver. 13. <hi>As a Father hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion of his children, ſo hath the Lord compaſſion on them that feare Him.</hi>

            <head>ENDEAVOURS Aiming at the glory of God, THAT PEACE and TRVTH may meet together.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving endeavoured (in the few lines preceding, or going before) to remove ſuch <hi>hinderances</hi> as lay in my way, and alſo to view ſome of <hi>thoſe materials</hi> which may be uſefull, in the drawing out a <hi>Platforme</hi> of ſuch a <hi>Government and Governours,</hi> as God hath preſcribed, recorded, and bleſſed, in his holy Word; I ſhall therefore in the firſt place lay down <hi>this Foundation,</hi> namely, <hi>That that government that God hath himſelfe preſcribed, and bleſſed, (in the firſt and pureſt times of government, and then when hee did in mercy and great favour moſt immediately preſcribe government;) is to be preferred very much and very far, before that government which came in long afterwards,</hi> being ſuch as <hi>the people</hi> choſe, and invented in <hi>imitation of the heathen Nations,</hi> and being ſuch a way and forme of <hi>government</hi> as God himſelf doth immediately oppoſe, and that in a very direct and eminent manner,) <hi>and is better then all other governments that men can preſcribe or invent whatſoever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt <hi>reaſon</hi> why that <hi>government</hi> is beſt that God preſcribeth is, becauſe <hi>Gods works and rules are the moſt perfect workes and rules:</hi> there needeth nothing to be added to them, nor nothing to be taken from them, as may evidently be ſeen, by and in the <hi>whole frame of the Creation of Heaven and Earth, and all the creatures in them contained.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="92" facs="tcp:117747:48"/>
            <p>The ſecond <hi>Reaſon</hi> is becauſe <hi>God is infinitely wiſe,</hi> no wiſdom is to be compared with his wiſdom.</p>
            <p>The third <hi>Reaſon</hi> is becauſe <hi>God varieth not; hee is yeſterday, and to day, and the ſame for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fourth <hi>Reaſon</hi> is, becauſe <hi>God is moſt ſtrong, able to protect his own Workes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fifth <hi>Reaſon</hi> is, becauſe <hi>God loveth and bleſſeth his own Workes, and Rules, and maketh them to proſper.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſixth <hi>Reaſon</hi> is, becauſe <hi>God is true and faithfull, in all his Word and Promiſes:</hi> now God hath promiſed to bleſſe and to proſper his own <hi>Rules,</hi> and <hi>Directions,</hi> and ſo it evidently appeareth that he hath done.</p>
            <p>On the contrary <hi>that government</hi> which people preſcribe is very much worſe, and exceeding inferior, to that which God preſcribed: firſt becauſe <hi>that mans wiſdome, power, truth, and mutability, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely inferior, to the wiſdome, power, truth, and immutability of God.</hi> As doth appear plainly in that men, when they laid their heads and wills, and powers together, to oppoſe <hi>Gods Determinations;</hi> all their higheſt labours and endeavours, reached no higher, nor no further, then to build a <hi>Tower of Babell,</hi> tending to confuſion; this will fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther appear if we conſider <hi>this particular caſe</hi> in the <hi>matter of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> for thoſe <hi>Iudges,</hi> and that <hi>forme of government,</hi> which God did in his wiſdom appoint to his <hi>beloved first borne Sonne,</hi> in the firſt and pureſt times of <hi>government</hi> from <hi>Moſes</hi> to <hi>Samuel,</hi> was much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then <hi>that government</hi> of <hi>Kings,</hi> which ſucceeded afterwards in <hi>more corrupted times,</hi> when God was angry with the people, and was ſuch a <hi>government</hi> as the people invented, in <hi>imitation of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, this <hi>government of God</hi> was better, and the <hi>Peoples</hi> worſe, becauſe <hi>God bleſſed his owne Directions, and Preſcriptions.</hi> It is to be noted that of all the <hi>Iudges</hi> that God appointed, immediately, or in which the people asked counſell of God, <hi>thoſe governours</hi> God bleſſed them with his <hi>good and holy Spirit,</hi> all of them from <hi>Moſes</hi> to <hi>Samuel,</hi> there was not one of them an <hi>evill governour</hi> (that I can find) and they all proved <hi>bleſſings to the people;</hi> But thoſe governors that <hi>the people</hi> choſe and invented themſelves, many or moſt of them God did not ſo bleſſe with his <hi>good and holy Spirit,</hi> and they proved <hi>curſes and croſſes to the people,</hi> and were <hi>great afflictions to the people,</hi> as appeared in <hi>Abimeleck,</hi> in <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> in <hi>Ahab</hi> and others.</p>
            <pb n="93" facs="tcp:117747:48"/>
            <p>Next let us conſider, <hi>That this people the children of Iſrael had the beſt forme of government</hi> from <hi>Moſes</hi> to <hi>Samuel,</hi> which appeareth from the conſiderations of diverſe Scriptures, <hi>Exod.</hi> 5. God there ſaith <hi>yee ſhall be my chiefe treaſure, though all the people of the Earth be mine;</hi> this place ſheweth that God preferred <hi>this people</hi> at this time above all <hi>other people,</hi> therefore it may plainly be gathered that God took more ſpeciall regard to appoint them a <hi>better government</hi> then <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nations;</hi> but <hi>other Nations</hi> had <hi>Kings</hi> at that time, and God preſcribed, and appointed to them <hi>Iudges</hi> at that time. Therefore <hi>government</hi> by <hi>Iudges</hi> in that firſt and pureſt times, were better then <hi>government</hi> by <hi>Kings.</hi> Read <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.16. <hi>So ſhall I and thy people have preheminence above all people that are on the Earth;</hi> here again the ſame is repeated, to ſhew that <hi>this people</hi> had <hi>preheminence</hi> above all <hi>other people;</hi> and ſhould they be preferred in <hi>ſmaller matters,</hi> and not in <hi>this matter of government,</hi> being a <hi>matter</hi> of the <hi>greateſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment?</hi> Read <hi>Levit.</hi> 9.23. <hi>and the glory of the Lord appeared unto all the People:</hi> from this place it appeared, that in <hi>this moſt excellent mercy,</hi> they were far preferred before <hi>other people,</hi> for did any other People ſee <hi>the glory of the Lord</hi> as they did? no verily. Read <hi>Levit.</hi> 26.12. <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.5. <hi>Behold J have taught you Ordinances, and Lawes, as the Lord my God commanded mee, that yee ſhould do.</hi> Ver. 6. <hi>keepe them therefore and do them for that is your wiſdome, and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> Ver. 7. <hi>For what Nation is ſo great to whom the Gods came ſo neare unto them, as the Lord our God is neare unto us in all, &amp;c.</hi> Ver. 8. <hi>And what Nation is ſo great that hath Lawes ſo righteous, as all this Law that I ſet before you this day?</hi> Ver. 9. <hi>But take heede to thy ſelfe and keepe thy ſoule diligently, that thou forget not theſe things, and that they depart not out of thy heart all the dayes of thy life, but teach them thy ſonnes and thy ſonnes ſonnes.</hi> Ver. 2. <hi>Yee ſhal put nothing to the Word which I command you, neither ſhall you take ought there from, that yee may keepe the Commandements of the Lord your God, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Deare Friends, let us well weigh the very expreſſe, and direct force of ſuch a plain downright <hi>Rule of God:</hi> God tells them <hi>that they had Lawes and Commandements, ſuch as no people on Earth had the like.</hi> Conſider what was meant by <hi>Lawes, and Precepts and Ordinances:</hi> This is meant by it, <hi>the whole frame of their government:</hi> For <hi>Rules, and Lawes, and Ordinances,</hi> implyeth moſt plainly two things: <hi>the governours,</hi> and <hi>the governed;</hi> for elſe to what purpoſe had God gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:117747:49"/> 
               <hi>the lawes:</hi> if he had not appointed <hi>governors</hi> to ſee <hi>thoſe lawes</hi> executed.</p>
            <p>We ſee it to be of <hi>neceſſity</hi> and moſt <hi>principall concernment,</hi> that in all <hi>combinations</hi> or <hi>ſocieties,</hi> wherein many act together, there muſt be <hi>Order,</hi> which is nothing elſe but <hi>government.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We ſee likewiſe that <hi>this government,</hi> being regulated, and orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red wiſely, juſtly, mercifully, &amp;c. This puts a beauty upon <hi>all matters</hi> to be acted by <hi>Societies.</hi> This <hi>Order</hi> in <hi>Government</hi> it puts a <hi>ſhining luſter</hi> upon all <hi>pieces of worke,</hi> and upon <hi>all Societies.</hi> Do but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw a wiſe and good <hi>government,</hi> and let either a <hi>foole,</hi> or a <hi>negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent perſon,</hi> or a <hi>diſordered Epicure,</hi> or a <hi>Tyrant</hi> mannage <hi>actions;</hi> and you ſhall preſently find that <hi>Workes</hi> or <hi>Societies</hi> guided by ſuch, will either turn into a <hi>Chaos,</hi> or into <hi>diſorder:</hi> or at the leaſt (in the beſt caſes) the <hi>luſtre</hi> and <hi>beauties of ſuch ſocieties, will be taken away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That which I ſhall then gather from <hi>theſe Scriptures</hi> is, <hi>that no Nation under Heaven had ſo good a government,</hi> (which is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expreſſed, in that none had ſo <hi>righteous Lawes, and Ordinances) as this people of Jſrael had now in this time of the Judges, now in theſe firſt and pureſt times, now in this time when God ſhewed his glory ſo eminently, now in this time when God came ſo neare unto this people as no Nation upon Earth had ſuch a government, ſuch governors;</hi> which is plainly implied, and expreſſed, under theſe words <hi>Lawes and Ordinances.</hi> This being true, then it followeth plainly, <hi>That this government by Judges was better, then the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by Kings:</hi> for at that time they had <hi>Kings</hi> in their <hi>Heathen governments,</hi> the <hi>Egyptians</hi> they had a <hi>King,</hi> a <hi>Tyrant,</hi> an <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous oppreſſor,</hi> a <hi>ripe of the Devill,</hi> but God ſaith <hi>that at that very time the Ordinances and Lawes, the whole-frame of their gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, and government was better then all other Nations did enjoy;</hi> then certainly it was better then the <hi>government</hi> by <hi>Kings.</hi> We can no way evade, or avoid (in a plain way of righteouſneſſe) <hi>this truth,</hi> it followeth plainly, directly and ſtrongly.</p>
            <p>But further, it appeareth clearly <hi>that this government was better then that government by Kings,</hi> becauſe <hi>God in his wiſdom ſaw this government to be beſt for his Church and people.</hi> God was the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of this government</hi> by <hi>Iudges,</hi> God did preſcribe <hi>this govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> and bleſſe <hi>this government.</hi> And God is not as man, his works are not imperfect, God ſeeth and knoweth at once what is beſt; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:117747:49"/> then, <hi>That God is likewiſe unchangeable:</hi> Concerning the <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by Kings,</hi> God was not ignorant of it, he ſaw <hi>that,</hi> but it plainly appeared that he approved not of it, becauſe nevertheles God preſcribed to the people this way of <hi>Government by Judges;</hi> this was <hi>Gods own Ordinance,</hi> and God ſaith, <hi>This Government was the beſt,</hi> no <hi>Nation</hi> had ſo good a <hi>Government,</hi> take it in what reſpect you will or can take it. Further let us conſider, <hi>That theſe Ordinances of God, theſe Laws, this Government preſcribed and bleſſed by God himſelf, do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in force to this day, they were never changed nor repealed to this very day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But do we not find, <hi>that there were ſome good Kings,</hi> as <hi>David, and ſome others?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> That proveth not in the leaſt, That the <hi>Government of the Kings</hi> was to be compared to that <hi>Government by Judges,</hi> becauſe this <hi>Government by Judges</hi> was <hi>Gods preſcription and direction,</hi> but that <hi>Government by Kings</hi> was <hi>the preſcription of the People, the Peoples invention, in imitation of the Heathen round about,</hi> and this was expreſly forbidden by God before in <hi>Deuteronomy, Thou ſhalt not follow the manner of the Heathen Nations round about:</hi> And it was expreſly againſt the Counſel of God, recorded by <hi>Samuel;</hi> it was againſt Gods Will, for though God did permit Kings to be, yet he did not ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally appoint them, but contrarily God dehorteth the <hi>people</hi> from having Kings in a vehement manner, and taking it in the higheſt degree to be both the breach of <hi>Gods Commands or Inſtitutions,</hi> and likewiſe a very <hi>forſaking of God,</hi> recorded by the <hi>Prophet Samuel,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.7. <hi>They have not cast thee away, but they have caſt me away.</hi> And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther note, That <hi>God</hi> out of his tender compaſſion to the <hi>people,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that they had caſt him away in the form of their <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> yet <hi>God</hi> lovingly admoniſheth the <hi>people, God</hi> giveth warning to the <hi>people</hi> what they ſhould get by having a <hi>Government by Kings,</hi> namely, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.11. <hi>This ſhall be the manner of the King that ſhall raign over you, He ſhall take your ſons and your daughters, your fields and your vineyards, your ſervants, your cattel and your ſheep, and ye ſhall cry out by reaſon of your oppreſſions, but I will not hear you in that day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Further conſider, That <hi>God</hi> did permit divorce in ſundry caſes, and did permit the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to have more wives then one; this <hi>matter</hi> (to my apprehenſion) hath a <hi>better footing,</hi> and much fairer ſhew of <hi>Gods approbation,</hi> then the <hi>Government by Kings;</hi> and notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:117747:50"/> 
               <hi>Christ our Lord</hi> ſaith, <hi>That this was not originally right, God did not in the firſt and pureſt Inſtitution ordain this matter;</hi> yet <hi>God</hi> did act in many caſes, and bleſſed children, and married perſons in this way. In the firſt being of <hi>Kings, God</hi> did act in this cauſe, as namely, <hi>God choſe Saul and David,</hi> yet nevertheleſs <hi>God</hi> did expreſly by the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Samuel,</hi> in threatning manner, admoniſh and foretel the <hi>people, That Kings would oppreſs the people, and make them cry out, and GOD would not alter the Government by Kings when they would.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Obſerve we well, That where men do not cleave cloſe to <hi>Gods Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinations, to his Inſtitutions,</hi> and do not prefer the <hi>Wiſdom of God</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their <hi>own wiſdom,</hi> it is a righteous thing with <hi>God</hi> to ſuffer them to ſmart, and to endure <hi>bitter afflictions,</hi> when we ſhall not have abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to help our ſelves: We have had experience of Kings from <hi>Samu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els</hi> time to this day, and now <hi>God</hi> hath given ſuch an opportunity as hath not been a long ſeaſon, now we have comfortable hope, <hi>that God will give and reſtore Judges as at the first, and Counſellors as at the beginning.</hi> Oh dearly beloved, whoſoever thou art, hinder not <hi>Gods Work of Reformation,</hi> left thou beeſt found a <hi>fighter against God;</hi> remember that our <hi>forefathers</hi> have been a <hi>gainſaying people,</hi> let not us, I pray you, reſiſt <hi>the good Spirit of his grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. But further conſider, That although <hi>David,</hi> and ſome other Kings, were better then the reſt, (God would not ſuffer the <hi>Rod of his Wrath</hi> to lie always ſo heavy as at ſometimes,) yet even <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> and others, were not bleſſed with the like <hi>meaſure of grace</hi> that the Judges were bleſſed with: Conſider, did <hi>Moſes, Joſhua, Gideon, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel,</hi> did they kill innocent <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah?</hi> Did they <hi>commit Adultery</hi> with <hi>Bathſheba?</hi> Did they <hi>number the people with David?</hi> Did they <hi>ſet up Idolatry, or ſuffer Idolatry?</hi> Did they <hi>build ſumptuous houſes,</hi> and <hi>gardens,</hi> and <hi>orchards,</hi> as <hi>Solomon?</hi> Did they commit ſuch <hi>abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> as many other <hi>Kings</hi> did? Conſider of it, <hi>That this Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by Judges, inſtituted by God himſelf, in theſe firſt and pureſt times, was the beſt Government, it was most for Gods glory, it was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his will, and it was moſt for the peoples good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Conſider, That although God commendeth <hi>David</hi> in the <hi>general,</hi> yet that proved nothing in this particular caſe, namely, it neither proveth to them be of <hi>Gods, first Inſtitution,</hi> nor any <hi>Inſtitution,</hi> not that place; for inſtance, if a maſter of a family having an hundred ſervants, ſome of theſe may be as perſonable, nay they may ſome of them be beloved
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:117747:50"/> of the maſter, and be rulers in the family; but this doth not prove. That the form of their <hi>government</hi> (being a form of their own inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) was or is ſo good a form, as that form of <hi>government</hi> that the maſter himſelf appointed. We ought warily to diſtinguiſh between thoſe <hi>matters</hi> that God doth <hi>permit,</hi> and between thoſe <hi>matters</hi> that God doth <hi>inſtitute</hi> and ordain. <hi>Adam,</hi> our grandfather, ſinned by <hi>eating of the forbidden fruit,</hi> yet nevertheleſs God made ſome of his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity <hi>Inſtruments of his glory,</hi> and they were beloved of God, yet it doth not thereby follow, That <hi>Adams</hi> condition was ſo good after as before. God ſaith, <hi>David was a man after his own heart,</hi> but it nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther followeth thereby, That all <hi>Kings</hi> were men after Gods heart in that ſence, nor doth it thereby follow, That the <hi>government by Kings</hi> was ſo good a <hi>government</hi> as the <hi>government by Judges,</hi> for that is againſt the expreſs <hi>letter of the Scripture,</hi> and againſt the <hi>experience</hi> of all ages to this preſent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> Doth not God ſay, That <hi>Kings ſhall be thy nurſing fathers, and Queens thy nurſing mothers?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This ſheweth, That although the people had deſerved, that God ſhould make all Kings to be <hi>enemies or ſcourges to the people, for rejecting God their King, and for their evil and obſtinacy, in forſaking the first and beſt form of government by Judges,</hi> (a form preſcribed and bleſſed by God,) yet this ſheweth, That God would not always be alike offended, he would let ſome <hi>Kings be nurſing fathers,</hi> although many were evil towards God and the people.</p>
            <p>Another inſtance conſider, A father, having many children, employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, or there is employed divers nurſes, ſome of his own chuſing, and ſome of his childrens chuſing; the father conſidering the childrens weakneſs and offence in chuſing other for nurſes without his order, he doth neither allow of their act in chuſing, nor of the perſons, although he may forgive his children part of their offence, and promiſeth that ſome of theſe ſhould prove nurſes to them, though many ſhould prove croſſes; this doth neither approve of his childrens act in breaking his way preſcribed, neither doth this indulgence or mercy in the father en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage or warrant other children to follow that way not preſcribed, but expreſly witneſſed againſt.</p>
            <p>One inſtance more to open the <hi>matter,</hi> conſider, Certain men being to go to a place far diſtant from them, there are divers ways that lead to the place, the maſter of the company he ſheweth to them the beſt way, but the company are obſtinate, and will
<gap reason="missing" extent="2 pages">

               </gap>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:117747:51"/> to King and Princes by deſcent, without enquiring <hi>Gods</hi> counſel, and ſo continued in the breach of Covenant, and of Gods Law; they had not yet reſtored God to be their King, as in the days of old, as in the beginning, This is plainly expreſſed in theſe words, <hi>Kings not by me; Princes, and I knew it not:</hi> As if God ſhould have ſaid, <hi>I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected they ſhould repent, and turn from their evils, and have enquired at, and taken my counſel, who ſhould be the man that ſhould be their chief Governor; but they go on, and obſtinately follow the counſel of their own hearts; They have Kings, but not by me; they have Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and I knew it not:</hi> that is, <hi>They did not come and make me ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted, they did not enquire of me who ſhould govern them:</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>the Enemy ſhall purſue them.</hi> But to go on, <hi>They have tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed my Covenant, and broken my Law;</hi> whence I gather plainly, That the Government by Judges, together with their entrance into their places, it was part of the Law of God; God did ordain and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point that the Government ſhould be by Judges; and that God would have that priviledg, that preheminency therein, that he would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted withall, who ſhould be the man that ſhould be principal Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor; that is to ſay, God, and not the people (without the expreſs counſel of God known) ſhould appoint the man, and name the perſon; and the erring from this here God calleth <hi>the tranſgreſſion of his Law, and the breach of his Covenant:</hi> That this is the very true minde of God, (I beleeve) the very words in the Text, and their application by God himſelf, do naturally and plainly hold out ſo much.</p>
            <p>But ſecondly, I gather this to be the meaning here, conſidering the preſidents preſcribed and practiſed by God himſelf; God mediately appointed <hi>Moſes, Joſhua, Gideon, Samuel,</hi> and ſome others: This ſheweth, that God did ordain and inſtitute not onely the form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment by Judges, but alſo God did himſelf immediately appoint the perſons; in which nomination we may obſerve, That God did not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point (in theſe firſt, and pureſt, and uncorrupted times) that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould go by Succeſſion, from Father to the eldeſt Son; <hi>Moſes</hi> had children, and other of the Judges had children, yet God in his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſaw it to be moſt for his glory, and for the peoples good, that the principal Government ſhould not be continued by deſcent: This plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeareth by thoſe preſidents in which God himſelf did the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately appear in, and the moſt immediately appoint: Afterwards, in more corrupted times, the people choſe by deſcent, but this proved not to be compared with that way which God in his heavenly wiſdom
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:117747:51"/> did appoint in the firſt, and in the pureſt and beſt Times.</p>
            <p>I ſhould further note divers things here, as their caſting God off, their puniſhments being the fruits the people reaped; but I forbear, and proceed; The Lord ſaith, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. Verſ. 2. to 9. <hi>That God had taught them Ordinances, therefore keep them, ſaith God: What Nation is ſo great that hath Laws ſo righteous as all this Law? Take heed to thy ſelf and keep thy Soul diligently, thou and thy ſons, and thy ſons ſons; Ye ſhall put nothing to the Word that I command you, neither ſhall you take ought there from:</hi> This people they were well diſciplined by <hi>God,</hi> &amp; they had the preſence of <hi>God</hi> ſo neer to them, and God was ſo tender over them, as appeareth <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.10. <hi>God led him about, he taught him, he kept him as the apple of his eye:</hi> Verſ. 11. <hi>As an Eagle ſtirreth up her neſt, fluttereth over her birds, ſtretcheth out her wings, taketh them and carrieth them on her wings:</hi> Verſ. 12. <hi>So the LORD alone led him, and there was no ſtrange god with him.</hi> Thus did God neerly ſhew the people his glorious majeſty, his power, his wiſdom, his Truth, his grace, goodneſs, bounty, mercy, his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeableneſs: When we conſider of it, we may ſay with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Iſaiah, Oh that we had harkened to Gods Commandments, then ſhould our prosperity have been like the floods, and like to the mighty waters:</hi> But alaſs, this people grew to be full, they were at eaſe, they were wanton, which God noted, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.15. <hi>He that ſhould have been upright, when he waxed fat, ſpurned with his heels;</hi> that is, he eſteemed theſe precious mercies to be of little value: Therefore God ſeeing this, ſaith, <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> 32. Verſ. 15. <hi>Thou art fat, thou art laden with fatneſs, thou art groſs; therefore he forſook God that made him, and regarded not the ſtrong God of his Salvation:</hi> God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moſt infinitely wiſe, he knoweth which way is beſt to remedy this diſtemper, namely, theſe ſurfets in proſperity; This therefore God telleth the people, admoniſhing them in the times of their proſperity to take heed to Gods Commandments, and not to turn any way aſide to the right or left hand, nor to add nor diminiſh: But obſerve we, this people would not harken, they would not be convinced that the wiſdom of God was beſt and ſafeſt for them: God had himſelf immediately preſcribed both the form of Government and the perſons; yet this people pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred <hi>the GOVERNMENT</hi> by <hi>KINGS,</hi> ſuch as the <hi>HEATHENS</hi> round about had (of which the <hi>LORD</hi> had ſaid to them, <hi>Ye ſhall not follow their Manners nor Cuſtoms,)</hi>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:117747:52"/> before the <hi>Government by Judges;</hi> and therefore the Prophet <hi>Samuel</hi> telleth them, that ſuch things would befall them by having Kings, but they would not harken to God, to the Prophet; Therefore the Lord fore-ſeeing and knowing what would follow, he admoniſhed them; they will not now be perſwaded; Take heed, for it is no <hi>light matter,</hi> for hereafter <hi>you ſhall cry out by reaſon of your afflictions, but I will not hear you;</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>you ſhall feel this breach of my Law and Covenant, Kings ſhall be your Oppreſſors, they will ſlay my Prieſts, ſet up Idolatry, force you to Idolatry; they will worſhip the hoaſt of Heaven, they will fill the ſtreets of Jeruſalem with blood; they will be the cauſes that my anger ſhall be kindled againſt you; they ſhall be the cauſes that I will bring an Enemy upon you, and deliver you into captivity: Hoſea</hi> 8. <hi>Therefore, ſaith the Lord, the Enemy ſhall pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue you;</hi> that is to ſay, he ſhall prevail againſt you: This ſhall come to paſs, becauſe <hi>you have broken my Law, and tranſgreſſed my Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; you have ſet up Kings, but not by me; and Princes, but I knew it not;</hi> as if God ſhould ſay, I did not acknowledg the way of Kings, I knew it not, &amp;c. <hi>and yet you repent not, you return not to me, &amp;c. Samuel</hi> faithfully and plainly fore-told this, 1 <hi>Sam. You ſhall cry out by reaſon of your afflictions at that day, but I will not hear you;</hi> you have choſen a form of <hi>Government by Kings,</hi> and Kings you ſhall have: This ſheweth, <hi>That the matter of Governors and Government is no light matter in Gods eſtimation;</hi> we may make as light a matter of it as we will, but God knoweth <hi>that Kings will afflict us, and oppreſs us, Kings will draw us to Idolatry, they will cauſe the fierce wrath of the Lord to break out againſt us.</hi>

            <p>Conſider of it, we have had the experience of above two thouſand years, what the fruits of Kings have been; ſearch diligently the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of the <hi>ſacred Scriptures</hi> (from <hi>Samuel</hi> his time to this preſent day) and the Records of all ages; How often have the people been toſſed to and fro in Religion, in War, in bloodſhed, under the <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Kings,</hi> the Father of one Religion, the Son of another? How much War and contention hath there been for to obtain Crowns and Kingdoms? Conſider of it; Was it ſo under the <hi>Government by Judges</hi> preſcribed by God? Did they perſwade the <hi>people</hi> to <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try?</hi> Or contrarily, did they not from time to time perſwade the <hi>peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> to <hi>the true Worſhip of God?</hi> Which of the <hi>Judges</hi> did ſtrive for the <hi>Government?</hi> But contrarily, the very firſt of the Kings did ſhed much blood, having in aſpiring mind to obtain the Crown, &amp;c.
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:117747:52"/> Search the Book of the <hi>Judges,</hi> concerning <hi>Abimelech</hi> and his fruits.</p>
            <p>Country-men, beloved, Conſider of it; I am perſwaded, That if ſuch experiences, ſuch admonitions, ſuch warning, as God hath given us, (recorded in the <hi>Scriptures</hi>) and from our own, and other <hi>Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> if theſe will not prevail; though <hi>Abraham</hi> ſhould ſend one to us from the dead, it would not prevail: One admonition more I deſire we may remember; God ſaith to <hi>Iſrael, They were full and fat, they would not ſerve the Lord in their own Land, in the abundance of all things; they would not obſerve Gods Law and Covenant without ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition or diminution, they would follow their own inventions:</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaith the Lord, <hi>they ſhould ſerve their Enemies in hunger, cold, and nakedneſs, in the want of all things, and in a ſtrange Land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Conſider (dearly beloved) <hi>That from the excellency of Government doth ariſe the happineſs and bleſſedneſs of the Saints in the Kingdom of Heaven:</hi> I pray you therefore let us ſet a high price upon <hi>Government.</hi> Let us proceed warily in <hi>matter</hi> of <hi>Government;</hi> let us enquire of <hi>God,</hi> let us follow the pureſt, the moſt clear and evident <hi>preſidents</hi> and <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions,</hi> without turning to the right or left hand; let us enquire for the old and good ways, preſcribed, owned, and bleſſed by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; againſt this there can be no juſt exception: And it may be God will ſee and regard us, and remember the riches of his own compaſſion, of his own precious promiſes, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 1.26. <hi>God will reſtore</hi> (which ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueth they then were not in being) <hi>Judges as at the firſt, and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors as at the beginning, then ſhall we be called a City of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, a faithful City.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I might multiply Teſtimonies, the <hi>Scripture</hi> is obvious and copious, but time bids me forbear; Therefore I go on to conſider a little more particularly <hi>Kings,</hi> concerning whom the moſt high and wiſe God did both ſee and know what and when the firſt King ſhould be, and how long the continuance of the <hi>Government</hi> of Kings ſhould continue, and when their Kingdoms ſhould be finiſhed; of this I doubt not, now the end of Kings and all other afflictions work together for the glory of God, and the good of Gods Elect: and I doubt not but that God would uſe ſome Kings as inſtruments, in ſome particulars, to be helpful to his Church and People.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> Some (and too many) uſe this as an argument, <hi>That Kings were good for Gods Church and People; for,</hi> ſay they, <hi>did not God make Promiſes to Kings of good things? and were not ſome Kings good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:117747:53"/> in ſome things to promote Gods glory? Did not Solomon build a Temple to the name of the Lord? &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> One inſtance conſider, <hi>Adam</hi> our great <hi>Grandfather,</hi> after he had broken <hi>Gods Commandment,</hi> and eaten the <hi>forbidden fruit,</hi> after this, and preſently upon the occaſion of what came to paſs by reaſon of his tranſgreſſion, God out of his bounty and goodneſs maketh a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of great worth to <hi>Adam</hi> and to his poſterity, namely, <hi>That the ſeed of the woman ſhould breaks the ſerpents head:</hi> Conſider now, would it be ſafe or ſound arguing to argue thus? <hi>Adam</hi> did well, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God in mercy gave him a <hi>precious promiſe?</hi> No verily; Or would it be ſafe to ſay, <hi>That we, ſome of his poſterity, may follow his ſteps in ſinning, becauſe that he obtained a precious promiſe?</hi> No veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; becauſe we are firſt to have reſpect to <hi>Gods Covenant,</hi> to <hi>his Law;</hi> And alſo we are to conſider, That the root from whence this promiſe ſprung, was not from, or becauſe God was pleaſed with (or approved of) <hi>Adams</hi> tranſgreſſion; but the Promiſe ſprung out of <hi>Gods abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant and rich mercy, and free grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From the premiſed reſpects and conſiderations I gather and conclude, That thoſe gracious promiſes, or acts, wherein God uſed Kings as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments or actors in ſome good things, theſe do neither approve of the <hi>Government by Kings,</hi> nor do they prove that the <hi>inſtitution of Kings</hi> was approved by God; and much leſs do they prove, <hi>That the Government by Kings was of equal goodneſs with the Government by Judges;</hi> in which the Word of God is plain and evident, <hi>That God preſcribed, owned, and bleſſed the Government by Judges:</hi> And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily the Word of God is plain, evident, and copious, <hi>That God did not allow of the Government by Kings, but did expreſly diſapprove of that form of Government by Kings;</hi> and to this we may add the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of the fruits of Kings to this very day.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> Some do uſe this argument to ſtrengthen the continuance of Kings, namely, <hi>That God did fore-tell that Kings ſhould be, and ſome Kings God did himſelf appoint.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> God did fore-tell that <hi>Iſrael</hi> would kick with their feet, and ſlight his Commandments; God did fore-tell that the people would reap bitter fruits from Kings: This doth not ſhew, that God did allow or approve either of the one, or of the other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>God</hi> did appoint ſome Kings immediately, ſhewing, that in this way, if the people had kept cloſe to <hi>God,</hi> and have gone no further backward from his Rules and Directions, then it ſhould have been better and ſafer
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:117747:53"/> for the People; it was too much to alter the forme preſcribed by God, but it was an addition to and aggravation of this ſinne, when they ſlighted God and did not enquire of God, who ſhould be the man that ſhould be their King, from time to time. When they followed the Rule and made him King whom the Lord did chuſe, (it may be noted that) <hi>God choſe Saul immediately by lot,</hi> wherin we may note <hi>that although God were angry, yet hee tooke thus much care for the People, that God let Saul (rightfully) raigne no longer as King, but ſo long as hee walked in Gods wayes,</hi> and during that time God gave <hi>Saul</hi> ſome portion of his <hi>good Spirit,</hi> or a ſpirit which made him ſutable in ſome proportion to govern his People, as appeareth. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.9. <hi>God gave Saul another hearts, and all thoſe tokens came to paſſe, &amp;c.</hi> And when <hi>Saul</hi> departed from God, and forſooke his Law, wee may note <hi>that God rejected him from being King.</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. <hi>ver.</hi> 26. <hi>Thou haſt caſt away the word of the Lord, and the Lord hath caſt away thee that thou ſhalt not be King over Jſrael.</hi> Ver. 28. <hi>Then Samul ſaid unto him, the Lord hath rent the Kingdome of Iſrael, from thee this day.</hi> And note now, that when <hi>Saul</hi> was depoſed, Chap. 16.14. <hi>The Spirit of the Lord departed from Saul, and an evill ſpirit ſent of the Lord vexed him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wee may note, that becauſe the people made <hi>David</hi> King a man choſen by God, (and not by the peoples raſh proceedings) that God gave to <hi>David his good and bleſſed Spirit.</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.13. <hi>Then Samuel tooke an horne of Oile and anointed him</hi> (David) <hi>in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest of his Brethren: and the ſpirit of the Lord came upon David from that day forward:</hi> here we may note <hi>that it is no vaine thing that God ſhould appoint our governors for us,</hi> God let the people taſte of the difference between <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Iudges,</hi> in that <hi>Salomon</hi> ſet up or countenanced <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and laid <hi>great taxations upon the people,</hi> yet it did not extend ſo far, not by very much, as afterwards the People felt under the <hi>government of other Kings,</hi> which were ſet up raſhly by the people, without ſuch an immediate call, (and for ought I know) not being anointed with Oile, by any <hi>true Prophet of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This I note the rather, becauſe I have reſpect to God his expreſſe Command and Direction (which was never reverſed to this very Day) recorded, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.14. where God ſaith <hi>if thou ſhalt ſay, I will ſet a King over mee like as all the Nations that are about mee.</hi>
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:117747:54"/> Ver. 25. <hi>Tou ſhalt make him King over thee, whom the Lord thy God ſhall chuſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall only at the preſent obſerve theſe two notes from this place, firſt <hi>that God doth not hereby either command, or allow that the People ſhould ſet up a Government by Kings;</hi> for the Lord ſaith, <hi>if thou ſhalt ſay I will ſet a King over mee,</hi> this came to paſſe in the Dayes of <hi>Samuel.</hi> Then the people they would have <hi>a King,</hi> the People here did not inquire of God, firſt now it doth not follow, that becauſe the People ſaid <hi>wee will have a King,</hi> that therefore God doth either approve or allow of <hi>this matter,</hi> but the direct con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary appeareth, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. in moſt eminent manner.</p>
            <p>But ſecondly, I do obſerve that God ſaith <hi>thou ſhalt</hi> (if thou wilt be wilfull and have a King, yet) <hi>thou ſhalt make him King whom the Lord thy God ſhal chuſe;</hi> here I put a reall difference between <hi>a King</hi> or <hi>governor</hi> being choſen by God immediately, and betweene the choiſe that <hi>the People</hi> make, <hi>I</hi> purpoſe if God will to ſpeak more of this in place afterwards.</p>
            <p>But this Rule alſo the People ſoone forſooke, namely <hi>they made themſelves Kings of their owne chuſing,</hi> wherein (<hi>I</hi> conceive) they did not inquire of God, <hi>who ſhould be the man,</hi> therefore the Lord ſaith <hi>they had Princes and hee knew it not;</hi> that is to ſay, they did not according to the Rule inquire of God, <hi>who ſhould be King.</hi> Thus much to ſhew, <hi>that it was better with the People when they eyed God, and kept cloſe to the Rule (when God choſe the perſon) then it was when they fell more fouly as afterwards they did;</hi> but this ſtill doth not prove <hi>that God did inſtitute that forme of government by Kings,</hi> or much leſſe <hi>that this forme of government was as good, and as well approved of by God, or ſo bleſſed, as the government by Judges.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to go on to ſpeake more punctually, or more particularly to <hi>the being of Kings;</hi> I ſhall endeavour (according to <hi>the meaſure of grace received</hi>) to ſpeak of them in <hi>true proportion,</hi> as God hath ſpoken of them in <hi>the holy and ſacred Scriptures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt King that <hi>I</hi> finde recorded was <hi>Abimeleck, Iudges</hi> 9. it is noted <hi>that this Man was no lawfull governor appointed by God;</hi> but <hi>one that uſurped the Kingdome, becauſe he entred not by and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the true way, wherein and whereby, God had preſcribed;</hi> which <hi>I</hi> believe was principally in regard that <hi>the People</hi> did not enquire of God, <hi>who ſhould govern them:</hi> but contrarily the People
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:117747:54"/> choſe him out of, or for <hi>ſiniſter reſpect,</hi> becauſe of <hi>affinity, kindred,</hi> and alſo, becauſe hee entered by force; wee may ſee what is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded <hi>Iudges.</hi> 9. By this mans <hi>government</hi> there were very <hi>ſad events,</hi> or <hi>fruits</hi> that followed or ſprung, for he was <hi>the occaſion of much evill and bloodſhed;</hi> this ſerveth to warne us to take heed that we enquire of God <hi>who ſhall govern us,</hi> and that we do follow the moſt cleare and evident <hi>Rules and Preſidents,</hi> preſcribed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in <hi>the ſacred Scriptures</hi> the ſure <hi>Rules of Truth:</hi> our <hi>Saviour</hi> teacheth <hi>that the true Shepherd entereth at the true doore,</hi> that is, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>the revealed will of God.</hi> And on the contrary <hi>thoſe Wolves and Foxes, do enter in at the window,</hi> that is (as <hi>I</hi> conceive) by ſome way that God hath not preſcribed, as by <hi>friends</hi> out of <hi>by reſpects,</hi> or by <hi>Fraude, Force, Mony, Beauty, Perſonage, Eloquence,</hi> or ſuch like; all of them not in ſuch away as is preſcribed in the moſt unerring <hi>Rules of Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After him aroſe <hi>Saul</hi> to be King, concerning his perſon, he was truly and rightfully called, being choſen by God, but concerning <hi>the forme of government by Kings;</hi> this was <hi>the Peoples</hi> invention, in imitation of the <hi>Heathen Nations,</hi> as appeareth, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.5. The people ſaid <hi>make us a King to judge us like all Nations:</hi> from this place <hi>I</hi> obſerve <hi>that it was not the Peoples demand to have this, or that man in particular to be their King; but they deſire onely to have a King.</hi> By which it appeareth that this ſinne lay, not in regard of <hi>the perſon,</hi> but it was in reſpect to <hi>the forme of government;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were governed by <hi>Iudges,</hi> which <hi>Forme of govermnent</hi> God did immediately preſcribe and owne it, and bleſſe it; but this <hi>Forme of government by Kings</hi> the people they did invent it, in imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the <hi>Nations</hi> round about; concerning <hi>thoſe Nations</hi> God had expreſly ſaid, <hi>that they ſhould not follow the manners and cuſtoms of the Nations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſecondly, againſt this way of government by Kings God doth (I believe) expreſly, evidently, and eminently oppoſe himſelf, in <hi>theſe particulars:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt God ſaith, <hi>that</hi> (by this meanes or way that the people here luſted after) <hi>they had caſt off God from being their King, or reigning over them.</hi> Which is expreſſed, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.7. <hi>They have not caſt thee away, but they have caſt mee away, that I ſhould not reigne over them;</hi> this (<hi>I</hi> conceive) is plainly implied, and expreſſed, that the greatneſſe of their ſinne lay in regard of the <hi>forme,</hi> and not in
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:117747:55"/> regard of the <hi>perſon,</hi> as if God ſhould have ſaid, <hi>they have not ſo much ſinned in deſiring another Governor,</hi> (although I believe this alſo was their ſinne) <hi>but they now have rejected the forme of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by me immediately preſcribed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Further God oppoſeth this forme of <hi>Government by Kings,</hi> immediately in ſhewing the People the great evills that they ſhould reape, by Kings, noted, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. From Ver. 9. to Ver. 19. <hi>Kings will take your Sonnes, and your Daughters from you, and will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point them to ſerve themſelves.</hi> (This God doth not ſay was lawfull for Kings to doe) for Gods Law was expreſſe to the contrary, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.21. <hi>Moreover thou ſhalt not do injury to a ſtranger.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did Gods Lawes permit that they ſhould wrong any man: and <hi>Samuel</hi> uſeth that as a ſtrong argument to convince them of their evill, namely, in theſe words, 1 Sam. 12.3. <hi>Behold here J am, beare record before the Lord of mee, whoſe Ox have I taken, or whoſe Aſſe have I taken, or whom have I done wrong unto, or whom have I hurt?</hi> Ver. 4. <hi>Then the People ſaid thou hast done us no wrong, nor haſt hurt us, neither haſt thou taken any thing of any Mans hand.</hi> Hereby appeareth <hi>the Peoples great evill</hi> and <hi>ingratitude,</hi> and their <hi>unrighteouſneſſe</hi> in forſaking <hi>that government,</hi> with which they could find no fault. Further this ſhewed <hi>that Kings would prove great evills, becauſe they would be great wrongers, and great oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, becauſe they would take by violence their choiſeſt comforts from the People.</hi> And further this ſhewed, <hi>that Kings would rule by the Rules of their owne wills,</hi> (in our dayes called <hi>their prerogatives</hi>) this is ſhewed in theſe expreſſions, <hi>Kings will take theſe and theſe things from you,</hi> but this they ought not to do, for herein <hi>Samuel</hi> ſheweth his integrity: we may obſerve <hi>that the Law of God ought to be the guide, the Rule, and the bounds, to all men high and low, to King and People,</hi> this is evident, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.16. to 20. There God ſaith, <hi>that the King ſhould have the Booke of the Law, and that hee ſhould reade therein all the dayes of his life, that hee may learne to feare the Lord his God: and to keepe all the words of this Law, and theſe Ordinances to do them: that his heart be not lifted up above his Brethren, and that hee turne not to the right hand, or to the left hand, &amp;c.</hi> From hence we may ſee <hi>that the King is not to do what hee listeth:</hi> but he is as expreſly commanded <hi>to obſerve and do the Law,</hi> as any other man, yea and in ſome ſort more, becauſe his example is more prevalent to draw others, either to good or evill.</p>
            <pb n="109" facs="tcp:117747:55"/>
            <p>But further wee may here note the difference betweene <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Iudges;</hi> the Kings they will do thus and thus, they will breake the bounds ſet unto them, but the <hi>Iudges</hi> were humble meeke men, this God knew when hee put in that clauſe (ſo nearely linked to the obſervation of his Law) namely, <hi>that his heart be not lifted up above his Brethren;</hi> experience hath taught us much of this (could we be warned) <hi>That Kings their hearts will be lifted up.</hi> Obſerve I pray you, the <hi>Iudges</hi> they acknowledged <hi>the People</hi> to be <hi>their Brethren,</hi> but <hi>Kings</hi> they ſay <hi>their blood</hi> and <hi>their diſcent</hi> is more <hi>Royall,</hi> more <hi>Illuſtruous,</hi> more <hi>Excellent,</hi> then thoſe they call <hi>the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer ſort,</hi> and <hi>the more ignoble.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is to be noted that in the firſt and pureſt times, thoſe men that were truly godly, truly vertuous, thoſe men that were moſt precize, that were the moſt obſervant of the Law of <hi>God.</hi> Thoſe men then were accounted to be the moſt noble, and ſo we finde they were in <hi>Gods</hi> eſteeme (for wee finde <hi>Moſes</hi> taken from <hi>keeping the ſheepe.</hi> And <hi>Gideon</hi> from <hi>threſhing,</hi> and <hi>David</hi> from <hi>the Sheepe-fold,</hi> and made <hi>Rulers of the People.</hi> But the World is now turned upſide-downe, for what do ſome men now applaud and worſhip but <hi>the Blood Royall,</hi> and <hi>Noble Blood?</hi> we have men now, that are truly noble and eminent for Piety, that ſway the <hi>government</hi> of the <hi>Common-wealth;</hi> but what is the tumult?

            </p>
            <p>But let us further note that this King <hi>Saul,</hi> or a <hi>King,</hi> or the <hi>Government by Kings,</hi> would not onely deprive <hi>the People of their Sonnes and Daughters,</hi> but alſo <hi>Kings would take their ſeede and their Vinyards,</hi> 1 Sam. 8.15. <hi>Their Men-ſervants and their Maide-ſervants, and the chiefe of your yong men, and your Aſſes, and Sheepe: and yee ſhall be his ſervants;</hi> Note I pray you, that this People had <hi>great liberty</hi> and <hi>freedome</hi> under the <hi>government</hi> by <hi>Iudges</hi> (could they have improved theſe with thankfull and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented hearts) but they would reject and ſlight <hi>theſe mercies,</hi> they would be governed by <hi>Kings,</hi> under which <hi>Government</hi> they ſhould endure many afflictions, but when it commeth to this height, <hi>that they themſelves ſhould be ſervants,</hi> then they begin to be more ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, then they cry out, but ſaith <hi>God,</hi> Ver. 18. <hi>The Lord will not hear you in the day, and time of theſe afflictions.</hi>

            <p>By this evident admonition it plainly appeared that <hi>God</hi> oppoſed in threatning manner, this <hi>government by Kings,</hi> for note that the cauſe here was not ſo much about <hi>the perſon</hi> to be made <hi>King,</hi> but it was about <hi>the forme of government by Kings.</hi> Note further how <hi>Samuel</hi> humbly and patiently doth argue the cauſe with the People <hi>Chap.</hi> 12. <hi>ver.</hi> 7. to 13. where <hi>Samuel</hi> putteth the People in minde how <hi>God</hi> had not bin wanting to them, but from time to time had raiſed up and appointed <hi>good governors</hi> for them. Which <hi>governors God</hi> protected, guided and bleſſed to them, and made them <hi>Saviours</hi> (and not <hi>oppreſſors</hi> nor <hi>deſtroyers</hi>) to them; ſometimes (for their ſinnes, and to prove them whether they would cleave to <hi>God,</hi> and to ſhew them the benefit that it was to have <hi>God</hi> to appoint <hi>good governors,</hi> and for other ends which <hi>God</hi> knew to be for his glory and their good) <hi>God</hi> did leave them without <hi>chiefe Iudges,</hi> and then we ſee the People they run into many by-paths, and ſinfull courſes, and then <hi>God</hi> ſuffered them to feele <hi>afflictions by enemies;</hi> but note <hi>that when the people conſidered the cauſe and ſought the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God, and cryed to God to helpe them, God never failed but anſwereth their petitions;</hi> note in what manner God anſwered them, he raiſed up <hi>Iudges,</hi> vvhich God made to be <hi>bleſſings,</hi> and <hi>Saviours</hi> to <hi>the People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From this expoſtulation of <hi>Samuel,</hi> we may obſerve <hi>that God by Samuel reproveth the People for altering that forme of government which God in his wiſdome had preſcribed, and bleſſed to the People;</hi> And the People could not deny the truth of this: but further note <hi>that God to the end that poſterity to come might evidently ſee his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, for that cauſe, becauſe the People had altered the forme of government by Iudges, and inſtead thereof had wilfully and obſtinately deſired a government by Kings,</hi> Therefore the Lord ſheweth the People by an eminent and wonderfull way expreſſed thus; 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.17. <hi>I will call unto the Lord and he ſhall ſend Thunder and Raine, that yee may perceive and ſee how that your wickedneſſe is great, which yee have done in the ſight of the Lord, in asking you a King.</hi> Ver. 18. <hi>Then Samuel called unto the Lord, and the Lord ſent Thunder and Raine the ſame Day, and all the People feared the Lord, and Samuel exceedingly.</hi> Ver. 19. <hi>The People ſaid wee have ſinned in asking us a King beſides all our other ſins, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Concerning this King we have occaſion to note, <hi>that Gods Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence did remove now and ſtand at a further diſtance then before,</hi> God
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:117747:56"/> did not wholy depart from them, but remembering the multitude of his mercies, he did ſtill favour the People, but as the <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> for the ſinnes of the People was removed out of the Hoſt, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.7.8. (Yet not wholy out of their ſight) ſo here God removed his <hi>gracious preſence</hi> further off from the People.</p>
            <p>The next King was <hi>David,</hi> who was a good and vertuous King, God would not afflict the People ſo much that they ſhould have no good Kings. <hi>Davids</hi> blemiſhes I forbear, though ſome blemiſhes he had, ſuch as (I believe) were not to be found amongſt <hi>the Iudges,</hi> that were immediately appointed by God to their place after ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded <hi>Solomon,</hi> how far he declined from the ſtraight Rules of <hi>Gods revealed Will,</hi> are to be found recorded in <hi>the Booke of Kings.</hi>

            <p>It is well to be conſidered of, that amongſt all <hi>the Iudges</hi> of <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:117747:57"/> (that came into their places according to <hi>Gods inſtitution</hi>) there was not one man of them (that I know of) that was taken away by <hi>the Sword of the enemy,</hi> nor by <hi>treachery</hi> ſlaine by their <hi>owne People,</hi> nor came to any <hi>untimely Death</hi> (ſave one man) and that was not for practicall evill of himſelfe, but for ſuffering ſinne to go without due puniſhment, in his children.

            <p>I know not any one of theſe, but that they are noted to be <hi>noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſinners,</hi> I doe let paſſe ſome others ſlaine, and carried captives, only theſe briefly (as the ſhortneſſe of time will permit) the Lord give us hearts to underſtand the meaning of <hi>the bleſſed ſpirit of God</hi> aright. Note here that God in his <hi>righteous Iudgements</hi> ſuffered, and appointed <hi>Kings</hi> to be puniſhed on earth. God did not let them alone to be puniſhed in another World.</p>
            <p>I do believe that all theſe were not to be approved in the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and manner of their ſlaughters; but ſome of them are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, and all of them are noted to bee taken away by <hi>Gods
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:117747:58"/> righteous judgements,</hi> for the breach of his <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Commandments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now let the ſincere godly hearted unpartially compare <hi>this govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by Kings,</hi> with <hi>that government by judges,</hi> in which I pray God to direct you aright.</p>
            <p>Thus have I endeavoured to preſent to our view the Kings that reigned over <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the Lord give us underſtanding to conſider what bitter fruits the People reaped by changing their forme of <hi>Government.</hi> I ſhall onely in this matter conſider that (doubtleſſe) theſe Kings many of them or others in their room would have beene much better, had the People kept cloſer to the Rules preſcribed, and from time to time enquired of <hi>God,</hi> who ſhould have beene the man that ſhould have governed them; for we may note that although God promſed <hi>David,</hi> that ſome of <hi>his poſterity</hi> ſhould governe; yet they ought <hi>to have made him King whom the Lord ſhould chuſe,</hi> Deut. 17. But we may note that <hi>God</hi> did ſo withdraw his <hi>good Spirit</hi> from the people, that I remember not that it is recorded from <hi>Solomons</hi> time and after, that the People did ever ſolemnly enquire counſell of God, Who ſhould governe them. I doe believe that if the people had ſolemnely and ſeriouſly ſought to God in this matter, God would have provided ſome of <hi>Davids</hi> poſterity from time to time, and ſo have bleſſed and guided them by <hi>his good Spirit,</hi> that they ſhould have beene much better then they were; but I doe believe God ſuffered them to ſwerve, that we by their examples might learne wiſdome, <hi>whatſoever was written before time was written for our learning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having thus far proceeded in laying downe, or deſcribing the <hi>Cauſe</hi> or <hi>Foundation,</hi> wherefore or whereupon I endeavour <hi>(in the feare and love of the great and moſt high God according to the meaſure of Grace received)</hi> to deſcribe ſuch <hi>a government, Governors,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with their <hi>entrances</hi> and <hi>authority,</hi> as God hath preſcribed, owned and bleſſed; in all which I doe conſider, that from the time of the Prophet <hi>Samuel</hi> to this day, there hath beene ſo great <hi>a ſwerving</hi> and <hi>declining,</hi> from that firſt moſt pure, and cleare <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,</hi> from thoſe moſt ſtraight, wholeſome, and good <hi>Rules, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts,</hi> and <hi>Commandments,</hi> deſcribed by that moſt high and onely Wiſe God; therefore I pray you blame mee not if I decline from humane authorities, in all this deſcription, I deſire to enquire for the <hi>old and good wayes of our good God.</hi> And I conſider that Gods Wayes, (his good Will and Pleaſure,) is moſt certainely (moſt
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:117747:58"/> wiſely, moſt apparently) made knowne in the <hi>Scriptures</hi> written by the <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> men that moſt truly and faithfully made knowne Gods good Will and Pleaſure (without mixture of their owne or other mens inventions.) Therefore I ſhall moſt chiefly and only in compariſon, <hi>alledge the authority of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:</hi> and the rather becauſe I conſider that as the interpoſition of the Earth, between the Sun and Moone, darkneth that light (and maketh an Eclipſe) whereby we are hindered from the more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent and clear light and benefit, that otherwiſe we might receive; ſo I feare it would come to paſſe, if I ſhould follow other inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; I am ſure that in this way the true light is moſt unerring. I ſhall next endeavour to ſhew what encouragement I finde recorded in the ſacred Scripture, that do ſtrengthen or encourage me to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve; <hi>That God now in theſe latter Dayes and Times, will reſtore and reforme government, ſo that we ſhall have</hi> Judges <hi>as at the firſt, and counſellors as at the beginning: and then wee ſhall be called a City of righteouſneſſe a faithfull City.</hi> I ſhall begin to propound to conſideration this Scripture, <hi>Eſai.</hi> 1.24. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, the mighty one of Iſrael, Ah I will eaſe me of mine adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, and avenge mee of mine en mies.</hi> Ver. 25. <hi>Then will I turne mine hand upon thee, &amp; burne out thy droſſe till it be pure, and take away all thy tinne.</hi> Ver. 26. <hi>And I will reſtore thy</hi> Judges <hi>as at the firſt, and thy counſellers as at the beginning, afterwards thou ſhalt be called a City of righteouſneſſe a faithfull City.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From this place I obſerve, <hi>That corrupt Governors are the great hinderances of Reformation,</hi> becauſe the Church ſhall then <hi>be a City of righteouſneſſe, when they have</hi> Judges <hi>as at the firſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, I obſerve, <hi>That ſuch corrupt Governors,</hi> and <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments God hath determined ſhall be put downe,</hi> this is expreſſed in theſe words, <hi>J will eaſe me of my enemies and burne out thy Droſſe,</hi> this is plainely implyed in theſe words, <hi>I will reſtore thy</hi> Judges <hi>as at the first, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, I obſerve that at this time when the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> wrote this ſentence or this precious promiſe. <hi>The government that then was in being</hi> (which was a government by Kings) <hi>was neither the firſt government, nor the beſt, or pure government;</hi> but hereby noted to be <hi>a corrupt government:</hi> If this were not the plaine and true meaning of theſe words (I believe) God would not have made this to be the way and meanes, whereby the Church ſhould become
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:117747:59"/> (in Gods eſtimation) <hi>a City of righteouſneſſe, and a faithfull City,</hi> and this appeareth if we do conſider that the way how, and cauſe why, they ſhould become a City of righteouſneſſe, was <hi>Becauſe a better government ſhould be to the Church and People of God, and that which then was in being ſhould be deſtroyed, but then the government was by Kings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, I obſerve that this government ſhould be reformed, or regulated according to the firſt and pureſt times, and by Judges, which being conſidered (I believe) it plainely followeth that from the time of <hi>Samuel</hi> to this day this propheſie hath not bin fulfilled and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed; becauſe, there hath not from that time to this bin ſuch a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,</hi> ſuch <hi>a Government by Iudges, as was in the firſt and moſt pure times,</hi> inſtituted, the moſt immediately, by God himſelf; and is held out in theſe words, <hi>As at the firſt, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, I obſerve that there is juſt ground to hope and believe that ſuch a Reformation God will worke, namely, <hi>that God will reſtore Iudges as at the firſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sixthly, I believe there are good grounds from this place (compared with the <hi>acts</hi> and great <hi>workes</hi> that, God is <hi>now working,</hi> and <hi>hath wrought</hi>) to expect, <hi>that this very time, is the time, or the beginning of the time God pointed out in this propheſie;</hi> Becauſe, that corrupt government by Kings is put downe, in ſuch a way of burning and righteouſneſſe, as hath not bin from that time to this day (as I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve) and ſuch an earneſt ſeeking and ſtrong endeavours, as hath not bin uſuall, for <hi>to ſet up and reſtore a government by Iudges as at the firſt;</hi> in which endeavours I cannot but acknowledge that (I believe) it evidently appeareth. That, many men have <hi>affectionately endeavored</hi> (with the hazard of their lives and of all their worldly comforts) to obtaine <hi>a government,</hi> ſuch as might be for <hi>the glory of God</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his <hi>Will</hi> revealed, <hi>as at the firſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Object. <hi>How commeth it then to paſſe that ſin abounds ſo much, and that wickedneſſe is not more ſuppreſſed?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> We are to conſider that great workes are not alwayes finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſo ſoon as they are begun. God may ſuffer ſome ſins now more then ordinary to appear, that by that meanes we may ſee them, and ſee the ev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ll of them, and the danger of them, and by ſeeing them we may ſee how, and where they may be rooted up: this government is yet in agitation not fully ſettled, (as I conceive) they have many occaſions, their Enemies not wholy ſubdued.</p>

            <p>We may obſerve that in thoſe times when <hi>God</hi> was about to work the greateſt deliverances for his Church, <hi>God worketh by contraries,</hi> (in mans apprehenſion,) when <hi>Iſrael</hi> was neareſt to their <hi>deliverance out of Aegyt,</hi> then God let them taſte the moſt bitterly of he yoke of their oppreſſion, although <hi>Moſes</hi> at the ſame inſtant was labouring for <hi>their</hi> deliverance.</p>
            <p>Secondly, can we ſee no reformation? conſider, <hi>that the Goſpell hath free liberty to be preached, many Congregations are much reformed, and a free liberty for Reformation to others, Idolatry is ſuppreſſed, the Miniſtery and People are freed from thoſe troubles in conſcience, that formerly they would have beene glad to have beene eaſed of,</hi> and further conſider, that in theſe times <hi>there is much more light;</hi> many things (formerly obſcured and hid) are now appeared, and concerning thoſe ſins that are a juſt cauſe of griefe (I believe when government is ſetled) they will be <hi>driven away as chaffe before the winde;</hi> and touching thoſe Burdens and Taxations, I believe they are our gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors griefe to impoſe them, and I hope God will ſhew them a meanes to <hi>eaſe them,</hi> and <hi>to take them away;</hi> in the mean time let us ſeek God unfainedly, and God will anſwer us graciouſly.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, let us conſider which party (thoſe that are for, or thoſe that are againſt this preſent government or Army) be moſt <hi>guilty</hi> of the <hi>ſin,</hi> moſt reigning; I ſhall ſpeak ſomething what my own experience reacheth, and ſo far as my <hi>memory</hi> and <hi>opportunity</hi> hath received from other men.</p>
            <p>Thoſe generally that ſtand for the <hi>Army</hi> and <hi>Parliament</hi> are godly, or civill the moſt of them, I know not one other wayes.</p>
            <p>Thoſe that are againſt them are many of them, ſuch as I have heard my ſelf (with much grief, that have bin <hi>ſwearers,</hi> moſt notoriouſly, and have ſpoken of the ſecrets of nature of Men and Women, in ſuch a manner, as if they had <hi>never lived where Gods Word had come to their knowledge,</hi> in ſuch a manner as the very <hi>Indians</hi> (that are civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized) are aſhamed of, or not accuſtomed to; in ſuch a manner, as <hi>That their mouthes are filled with curſing and bitterneſſe, deſtruction and calamity are in their wayes, the way of Peace they have not knowne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I leave them, and ſpeak to ſome other, I believe there may be many (ſome I know) of whom I am perſwaded I may ſafely affirm, <hi>That they are the elect of God,</hi> and yet nevertheleſſe through weakeneſſe (for ſo I judge it to be) do not favour the <hi>Army</hi> and the <hi>preſent
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:117747:60"/> government;</hi> I hope God will ſhew them juſt cauſe <hi>to ſee their error, and to acknowledge it in this particular.</hi> But concerning thoſe that ſtand for the <hi>preſent government and Army,</hi> I know not, nor have I diſcourſed with, nor heard of any one Man that hath <hi>cordially favored</hi> the proceedings of the <hi>Army</hi> and this <hi>preſent government,</hi> but they appeare to be either <hi>godly</hi> or <hi>civill,</hi> not openly prophain (I would not be miſtaken, I ſpeak not in this particular what the Souldiery may be, I mean the common Souldiery may be) I know nothing againſt them; but this I can affirm upon my own knowledge upon inquiry, in <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall,</hi> and in <hi>Devonſhire,</hi> they behave themſelves <hi>ſo orderly,</hi> that I much rejoyced to ſee <hi>their civill and orderly carriage;</hi> and I did purpoſely enquire of the Inhabitants, and I remember not any one but did acknowledge, <hi>that they carried themſelves orderly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To conclude my Anſwer to this Objection, I do acknowledge <hi>ſin is committed too openly in the ſight of the Sun,</hi> there are many <hi>offences.</hi> Let us all look to it, for Chriſt Jeſus the Sonne of the bleſſed God ſaith that, <hi>woe be to him by whom the offence commeth.</hi> Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there is a righteous God that will prove and try all our <hi>hearts</hi> and <hi>workes,</hi> to whoſe <hi>righteous judgement</hi> I willingly refer the Cauſe.</p>
            <p>I humbly requeſt thoſe that fear God not to be offended, for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that many take liberty to the utmoſt to detract the <hi>Army,</hi> and <hi>preſent government;</hi> therefore give me a little liberty. I would not exceede the bounds preſcribed by God. But to return to ſhew cauſe why we may now expect Reformation <hi>Iudges is at the first:</hi> this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing is the ſeventh Obſervation gathered from this propheſie: name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>becauſe God hath ſtirred up many godly and learned, in theſe times to put in writing what they have gathered from the propheſies of the Prophets,</hi> and theſe joyntly and unanimouſly do agree (ſo far as I know) that near to theſe times <hi>God will doe great things,</hi> ſuch as have not bin done for a long ſeaſon) <hi>in reforming matters, in exalting,</hi> and <hi>lifting</hi> up his <hi>Church</hi> out of <hi>affliction.</hi> This is an encouragement to us, to hope and expect, that we ſhall <hi>have Iudges as at the firſt, and counſellors as at the beginning, then ſhall we be a City of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, a faithfull City.</hi> Unto the foreſaid Scripture we may add that <hi>Eſai.</hi> 2.2. It ſhall be in the laſt dayes, <hi>that the Mountaine of the houſe of the Lord, ſhall be exalted in the top of the Mountaines, and ſhall be exalted above the Hills, and all Nations ſhall flow unto it:</hi> I leave this to your conſideration. Read <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.24, 25, 26, 27. <hi>The
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:117747:60"/> ten Hornes that thou ſaweſt, are ten Kings that ſhall ariſe, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall ariſe,</hi> Ver. 25. <hi>and ſhall speake words againſt the moſt high, and ſhall conſume the Saints of the moſt high, and thinke that hee may change Times and Lawes; and they ſhall be given into his hand untill a time, and times, and the dividing of time.</hi> Ver. 26. <hi>But the judgement ſhall ſit, and they ſhall take away his Dominion, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume it, and dectroy it unto the end: and the Kingdome and Dominion, and the greatneſſe of the Kingdome, under the whole Heaven, ſhall be given unto the holy people of the moſt high, whoſe Kingdome is an everlaſting Kingdome, and all powers ſhall ſerve and obey him.</hi> From theſe precious Promiſes or Propheſies recorded by the Prophet, I ſhall collect ſuch things as (I do conceive) do plainly ariſe from the Text.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that Kings ſhould be enemies to the Saints and people of the moſt high, and ſhould do much damage to them during their govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that they ſhould be lifted up in their own imaginations to think that they might change <hi>Times</hi> and <hi>Seaſons:</hi> by which, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, is meant that they ſhall endeavour to govern (not according to the preſcribed rules of God, but) by their prerogatives royall (as they terme it) that is, according to what ſeemeth good in their eyes, being beyond thoſe limits which God hath preſcribed in his Law: this, I conceive, is plainly held out in theſe expreſſions, and think that they may change Times and Seaſons: by Times and Seaſons may be meant <hi>ſuch things as are already preſcribed, by a higher power, within bounds,</hi> and by the <hi>wiſdome of him</hi> that had true <hi>authority</hi> to appoint ſuch <hi>Rules.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, I obſerve that ſuch <hi>corrupt Governours</hi> ſhall be <hi>deſtroyed and put downe</hi> by thoſe that God in his wiſdom appointed as inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>to accompliſh his decrees.</hi> This is plainly held out in theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, <hi>And they ſhall take away his Dominion to conſume, and to deſtroy it unto the end, noted</hi> Ver. 26.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that now in theſe latter times God hath determined, to <hi>reſtore</hi> and to <hi>reforme</hi> government, which (I conceive) is plainely held out in theſe expreſſions. Ver. 27. <hi>The Kingdome and Dominion, and the greatneſſe of the Kingdome, under the whole Heaven, ſhall be given to the holy people of the moſt high, whoſe kingdom is an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting kingdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, that this propheſie is not yet fully accompliſhed, becauſe it appeareth plainly (to my beſt underſtanding) that from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:117747:61"/> 
               <hi>Daniels</hi> time to this time, the <hi>government under the whole Heaven</hi> was not yet given <hi>to the holy people,</hi> and alſo becauſe this Kingdom this government, or this power taken out of the hands of the foregoing Kings, ſhall be <hi>everlaſting,</hi> it ſhall continue notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all oppoſitions againſt it, I leave theſe things to due conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Reade <hi>Micai</hi> 4.1. to 9. <hi>But it ſhall come to paſſe in the laſt dayes, that the Mountaine of the houſe of the Lord ſhall be prepared in the top of the Mountaines, and it ſhall be exalted above the Hills.</hi> Ver. 3, <hi>And hee ſhall judge among many people, and rebuke mighty people a farre off, and they ſhall breake their Swords into Mattocks, and their Spears into Sithes, Nation ſhall not lift up a Sword againſt Nation, neither ſhall they learne to fight any more.</hi> Ver. 4. <hi>But they ſhall ſit every man under his owne Vine, and under his own Fig-tree, and none ſhall make them afraid, for the Mouth of the Lord hath spoken it,</hi> Ver. 7. <hi>and the Lord ſhall reigne over them in Mount Sion from hence forth for ever.</hi> Ver. 9. <hi>Now why doſt thou cry out with lamentation there is no King in thee, is thy counſellor periſhed? for ſorrow hath taken thee as a woman in travell.</hi> Ver. 12. <hi>But they know not the thoughts of the Lord, they underſtand not his counſell; he ſhall gather them as ſheaves in the barne.</hi> Ver. 13. <hi>Ariſe threſh O Daughter of Sion for I will make thy horne Iron, &amp;c.</hi> This pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie (I do conceive) is not fully yet fulfilled and compleated, for although it might have reſpect to the comming of Chriſt; yet it holds out more matter then (as I conceive) yet is come to paſſe, becauſe the propheſie recorded <hi>that men ſhould breake their ſwords into mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocks, and their speares into ſithes, Nations ſhall not lift up a ſword againſt Nations, neither ſhall they learne to fight any more.</hi> This I conceive cannot be accompliſhed, becauſe if we underſtand it in any ſence (I ſee not that) this is yet accompliſhed, but is ſtill to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed. And for ſeverall other reaſons here aledged, which I leave to conſideration. Reade <hi>Revel.</hi> 11.15. <hi>And the ſeventh Angell blew the Trumpet, and there were great voices in Heaven, ſaying the kingdomes of the World are become the Lords, and his Chriſts, and he ſhall reigne for evermore.</hi> From this place (I conceive) may be gathered that the governments ſhall be reduced to ſuch a method and forme as God hath preſcribed in his holy Word, according to the firſt and moſt immediate pure inſtruments. Reade <hi>Revel.</hi> 14.8. <hi>And there followed another Angell ſaying, Babilon that great City is fallen is falen;</hi> Now we may note that Babilons confuſion ſpringeth from
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:117747:61"/> this root, for want of <hi>good Government;</hi> this is the very root of the ſin and diſorder, namely, <hi>evil Government;</hi> for if we read the <hi>Records of the Kings of Iſrael,</hi> and take notice, we may plainly ſee, <hi>That evil and corrupt Governors brought confuſion to and amongst the People;</hi> on the contrary conſider, That in an orderly, and in a rational way, when God will bring his people out of confuſion into order, God will certainly <hi>reform Government,</hi> that being <hi>the principal inſtrumental way of Reformation;</hi> ſo then, when God foretelleth, <hi>That the Babel of Confuſion ſhall fall,</hi> this is a principal part of the meaning, namely, <hi>That corrupt Governors muſt fall with or before it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Time bids me forbear to multiply places, there are many godly and learned men that have written largely and learnedly concerning <hi>Babele</hi> fall, to whom I refer the <hi>Reader</hi> for further ſatisfaction, and ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this Point with that which is written, <hi>Revel.</hi> 18.8. <hi>Therefore ſhall her plagues come at one day, death, and ſorrow, and famine; and ſhe ſhall be burnt with fire, for that God which condemneth her is a ſtrong God:</hi> (Note I pray you in the verſe before, <hi>She ſate as a Queen, and lived in pleaſure;</hi>) Was not this draught much like the picture of evil Kings? But Verſ. 9. <hi>The Kings of the earth ſhall bewail and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment over her:</hi> (Note, that <hi>the Kings of the earth</hi> are noted to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and to fear her torments: Why ſhould they fear? <hi>Anſ.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a guilty conſcience cauſeth fear, they being ſenſible that they have ſo ſlighted Gods Law:) <hi>which have committed fornication,</hi> (note like <hi>fornication,) and lived in pleaſure,</hi> (note uſually, that is one note, they <hi>lived voluptuouſly) with her,</hi> (theſe words <hi>(with her)</hi> imply a near conjunction,) <hi>when they ſhall ſee that ſmoak of that Her burning:</hi> Verſ. 10. <hi>And ſhall ſtand afar off for fear of her torment,</hi> (and why? Is it not becauſe it threatned them?) <hi>ſaying, Alas, alas, that great City Babylon, that mighty City, (is fallen, is fallen,) for in one day thy judgment is come.</hi> Verſ. 11. <hi>And the Merchants of the earth ſhall weep and wail over her, &amp;c.</hi> Verſ. 17. <hi>And every ſhip-maſter, and all that occupy ſhips, and ſhip-men, and whoſoever trafique on the ſea, ſhall cry, Alas, alas, that great City, &amp;c. is made deſolate.</hi> But note I pray you what the bleſſed Servants of God eſteem of this fall of <hi>Babylon,</hi> this is noted, Verſ. 20. <hi>O Heavens, rejoyce over her, and ye holy Apoſtles and Prophets, for God hath puniſhed her to be revenged on her for your ſakes.</hi> I pray you conſider why the <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles</hi> ſhould in ſuch <hi>primary</hi> and <hi>particular</hi> manner rejoyce over her? <hi>Anſw.</hi> Was it not becauſe <hi>ſhe ruled by her prerogative, by her own
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:117747:62"/> will,</hi> and would not be ruled and guided by the <hi>Writings of them, the Prophets and Apoſtles;</hi> therefore the <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apoſtles</hi> (whoſe <hi>Writings</hi> this great Whore had ſlighted) are noted in ſuch a <hi>peculiar</hi> and <hi>eminent</hi> manner to rejoyce at her down-fall</p>
            <p>To conclude, (if ſhe be falling or fallen) I hope God will keep me that I ſhall not under-prop her to keep her up.</p>
            <p>Thus (I beleeve) by this <hi>Babel of Confuſion</hi> is plainly held out (by the <hi>bleſſed Spirit of God,</hi>) That <hi>corrupt Government</hi> and <hi>corrupt Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors</hi> are to be underſtood thereby, which <hi>Babel of Corruption</hi> muſt be put down, this being the root (of confuſion) muſt be plucked up by the very roots.</p>
            <p>And further note, That the very true way to be beautiful and good order muſt ariſe from <hi>good Government</hi> and <hi>good Governors,</hi> therefore if ever we do become <hi>a City of Righteouſneſs,</hi> and <hi>a faithful City,</hi> let us very circumſpectly and with all diligence) labour, <hi>that we may have Judges as at the firſt, and Counſellors as at the beginning;</hi> that is to ſay, as in the firſt, and in thoſe moſt uncorrupted times, when God did the moſt immediately appoint <hi>Government</hi> and <hi>Governors:</hi> Let us keep cloſe to <hi>Gods Rules,</hi> and then we ſhall not err.</p>
            <p>Thus much briefly I have writ to ſhew ſome grounds that ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then me to expect, That now in theſe latter times God will do ſome <hi>eminent matters in the Reformation of Government,</hi> and (to my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion) theſe actings of God in theſe times do hold out ſuch a thing, namely, <hi>That God is exalting his poor afflicted (and ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiſed Servants and People.)</hi> I leave it to conſideration.</p>
            <p>I ſhall, by the aſſiſtance of <hi>Gods good Spirit</hi> (which I hope and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve I am guided by) now proceed to <hi>deſcribe Government</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as I find it <hi>preſcribed, owned and bleſſed by God,</hi> and <hi>recorded in the ſacred Scriptures,</hi> and <hi>as at the firſt in the pureſt times:</hi> Therefore, firſt, I find, <hi>That God did begin the model, or the form, or the compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Government at the head or chief Ruler: Moſes</hi> was the firſt, touching his entrance, he was called immediately by God, and ſo were divers others till <hi>Samuels</hi> time. And becauſe <hi>Gods preſidents</hi> and <hi>doings</hi> are done in ſuch perfect manner, with ſuch wiſdom, and ſo exactly uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and fit for thoſe employments that God diſpoſeth them unto; therefore I conceive it may not be unuſeful to commend ſomething to conſideration touching this man; and firſt God ſetteth out or deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth his parentage, <hi>Exod.</hi> 2.1. <hi>There went a man of Levi, and took to wife a daughter of Levi:</hi> Verſ. 2. <hi>And the woman conceived, and
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:117747:62"/> bare a ſon,</hi> (which was <hi>Moſes.</hi>) Here God doth not deſcribe any great difference between his parentage, and the parentage of the reſt of thoſe people that God called him to govern. The like is noted in the reſt of thoſe <hi>Judges</hi> which God did immediately call, and in the beſt of Kings, <hi>David,</hi> who was a man <hi>God</hi> did immediately in mercy appoint to govern his people <hi>Iſrael;</hi> this <hi>David,</hi> the beſt of the Kings, was <hi>cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen by God,</hi> and taken (not for his <hi>eminent kindred,</hi> but) out of a <hi>low condition.</hi> From hence I obſerve, <hi>That God doth not look or chuſe Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors out of or by respects, as man uſually doth:</hi> Man uſually look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon the outward man, this was <hi>Samuels error;</hi> man looketh at <hi>beauty, riches, kindred, rich or great parentage,</hi> at <hi>eloquence,</hi> and the like, which reſpects uſually lead men to chuſe thoſe men that prove uſually neither any <hi>great promoters of Gods Glory,</hi> nor of the <hi>Peoples good.</hi> God looketh at the <hi>inner man, at the graces of his own Spirit in their hearts,</hi> and principally God looketh at <hi>his own Inſtitutions,</hi> when ſuch a man is made Judg as entereth into his office and charge purely according to <hi>Gods Inſtitution,</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o as God in his Word hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, <hi>then God bleſſeth ſuch with his Spirit.</hi> It is remarkable, that <hi>Moſes</hi> pleaded his <hi>inſufficiency</hi> for that work God appointed him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, (recorded for our learning,) <hi>Exod.</hi> 4.10.11. <hi>Then the Lord ſaid unto him, Who hath given the mouth to man? or who hath made the dumb, or the deaf, or him that ſeeth, or the blind? have not I the Lord? Therefore go now, I will be with thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This conſideration holds out to us, of what high and great concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it is, to obſerve with carefulneſs and diligence <hi>how our Governors enter in, and take their offices and charges in Government;</hi> we cannot be too circumſpect in this matter, let us keep cloſe to thoſe firſt, moſt pure and unblemiſhed directions that God hath moſt <hi>immediately pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed,</hi> that are moſt <hi>clearly revealed in his ſacred Word,</hi> for that is our moſt certain guide, and the moſt ſure way to our <hi>future ſafety</hi> that poſſibly we can attain or reach unto.</p>
            <p>It is very obſervable, That of all the Judges that God did immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately chuſe (I cannot find) but that God endowed them all with his <hi>good and bleſſed Spirit,</hi> and not one of them but <hi>proved to ſeek Gods Glory, and the Peoples good,</hi> from <hi>Moſes</hi> to <hi>Samuel,</hi> which was ſo long as the people followed <hi>Gods Inſtitution in their Government.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And obſerve well, That ſo ſoon as the people were negligent in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing thoſe firſt and pure <hi>Inſtitutions,</hi> moſt <hi>clearly and primarily preſcribed by God,</hi> concerning <hi>Government,</hi> then God did withdraw
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:117747:63"/> his <hi>gracious preſence</hi> from them, and what <hi>miſery</hi> and <hi>affliction</hi> fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to them, and to their <hi>posterity,</hi> God in his ſacred Wiſdom hath left recorded (for our learning) in the Books of the <hi>Chronicles</hi> and <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah:</hi> How did theſe Kings draw the people from God into ſin, and brought the fierce wrath of God upon the people? And did not all this proceed from this root (namely from this) <hi>Becauſe they were negligent in the circumſpect obſervance of Gods Preſcriptions,</hi> and <hi>becauſe they leaned to their own underſtandings, and followed their own inventions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Oh that we, <hi>the People of England,</hi> might now be wiſe, and learn (by our own and other mens harms) to <hi>cleave cloſe to the moſt pure, moſt immediate, and firſt Inſtitution of Government, recorded in the ſacred Scriptures,</hi> ſo ſhould we ſecure our ſelves and poſterity, and obtain a bleſſing and protection from the <hi>glorious God of our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Oh dearly beloved, conſider I pray you, now there is ſuch an <hi>oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity</hi> as (I beleeve) God never offered to any <hi>generation,</hi> from the days of <hi>Samuel</hi> to this preſent time; now I pray you ſeek Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, ſeriouſly put forth your beſt and utmoſt endeavors, <hi>that we may obtain Judge as at the firſt, and Counſellors as at the beginning; then ſhall we be called a City of Righteouſneſs, a faithful City,</hi> Iſa. 1. by this means we ſhall become good examples to our <hi>neighbor Nations,</hi> and the generations to come ſhall have cauſe to praiſe the Lord for us, and the memory of our names recorded in <hi>Gods Records</hi> ſhall be eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally bleſſed.</p>
            <p>Concerning this man <hi>Moſes,</hi> being the firſt preſident God ſet to be <hi>Governor to his Church and People,</hi> becauſe <hi>Gods Works are moſt perfect, and of moſt ſingular uſe to poſterity,</hi> therefore I judg it neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to note ſomewhat touching his <hi>qualifications,</hi> he was a man painful and diligent in his charge, <hi>he ſate to judg the people from morning to night,</hi> Exod. 18.13. and afterwards in all his life we may note how <hi>ſtudious</hi> he was, and <hi>diligent,</hi> and <hi>active in obſerving Gods Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> and in <hi>exhorting the people to the ſame matters,</hi> he was not <hi>ambitious to ſeek great offices and preferments for his own children after his deceaſe;</hi> which may be noted, when <hi>Iſrael</hi> the people had highly provoked the Lord, ſo that <hi>God</hi> threatneth to deſtroy the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and promiſeth <hi>Moſes,</hi> that he would ſo far prefer him, <hi>that he would make of him</hi> (that is, of his poſterity) <hi>a mighty people,</hi> Exod. 32.10. <hi>Now therefore let me alone, that my wrath may wax hot against
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:117747:63"/> them, for I will conſume them, but I will make of thee a mighty people.</hi> Now <hi>Moſes</hi> preferreth the <hi>Glory of God,</hi> and the <hi>Peoples good,</hi> before any by reſpects, either to himſelf, or to his poſterity, noted <hi>Verſ.</hi> 11.12, 13. <hi>But Moſes prayed unto the Lord his God, and ſaid, O Lord, why doth thy wrath wax hot againſt thy people which thou haſt brought out of the Land of Egypt? &amp;c. Wherefore ſhould the Egyptians ſpeak and ſay, He hath brought them out maliciouſly, to ſlay them in the Mountains? &amp;c. Turn from thy fierce wrath, and change thy mind from this evil towards thy people, and remember Abraham, Iſaac, &amp;c.</hi> Verſ. 14. <hi>Then the Lord changed his mind from the evil which he threatned to do unto his people.</hi> This is recorded for the learning of ſucceeding ages, to ſhew of what concernment and what benefit the people get <hi>by living under ſuch a Government and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors as God ſendeth;</hi> ſuch <hi>Governors</hi> ſtand in the gap to keep off <hi>Gods displeaſure,</hi> and to procure a bleſſing for the people.

            <p>But ſecondly, This example of <hi>Moſes</hi> is of ſingular uſe, an <hi>eminent pattern</hi> to all <hi>Governors</hi> ſucceeding, namely this, <hi>That he ſought Gods glory, and the Peoples good, before his own or his childrens preferment:</hi> It is to be noted the like of him when <hi>God</hi> told <hi>Moſes</hi> he ſhould be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away or dye, he doth not requeſt of the Lord to continue the <hi>Government</hi> to his children, but this he doth, he loves the people, he looketh at <hi>Gods glory,</hi> and the <hi>peoples good,</hi> therefore he remembers the <hi>peoples good,</hi> and maketh earneſt prayer (recorded for our learning) to <hi>God,</hi> entreating <hi>God, That he would appoint a Governor for the people;</hi> where note the <hi>modeſty and humility of his heart,</hi> his <hi>ſpirit</hi> being not lift up above his brethren, therefore he expreſſeth it thus, <hi>That he may go in and out before the people, that the Congregation of the Lord be not as ſheep without a ſhepherd:</hi> Where we may note, That he ſtileth himſelf and ſucceſſor but under theſe expreſſions, <hi>Num.</hi> 27.16. <hi>Let the God of the ſpirits of all fleſh appoint a man over the Congregation.</hi> Verſ. 17. <hi>Who may go in and out before them, and lead them out and in, that the Congregation of the Lord be not as ſheep without a ſhepherd:</hi> Note his expreſſions, <hi>A man over the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> (not only a King, or by the name of Commander, but) only <hi>a man,</hi> and a ſhepherd; he had true reſpect and underſtanding of the nature of his charge and office, which was to order, to provide for, to
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:117747:64"/> feed, love, and defend the ſtock, (and not to perſecute, or to ſuffer Wolves to devour them, not to feed upon them himſelf,) therefore note his expreſſion, Verſ. 17. <hi>that the Congregation of the Lord:</hi> He remembred and modeſtly acknowledgeth the people to be Gods he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritage; He doth not ſtile them his Subjects, or his Vaſſals, (and ſo ſeek to leave the people, as <hi>inheritance of Goods, Lands, Beaſts,</hi> and <hi>Cattel,</hi> to his Children,) but he eſteems the people, and ſo they were (of more value then earthly inheritances) <hi>Gods inheritance;</hi> and ſo in expreſs words he calleth them, <hi>The Congregation of the Lord, the Lords In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, the Lords People;</hi> and therefore he doth not lay claim to them as the <hi>Inheritance</hi> for <hi>his Children,</hi> he knew Gods minde better, he ſpeaks no ſuch <hi>matter;</hi> for <hi>ſucceſſion in Government,</hi> from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the Son, came in long (many hundreds of years) after, in more corrupted Times; God did not, in theſe firſt and pureſt Times, in the original, order it to be ſo; neither did <hi>Moſes</hi> expect, or deſire it, becauſe he looked after thoſe <hi>matters</hi> that were truly his own; He truly ſought Gods Glory and the Peoples good: But thus much to ſhew <hi>his opinion</hi> and reſpect that he had of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in thoſe days. Thoſe firſt Governors <hi>owned the people to be their brethren, and ſo they behaved themſelves towards the people as bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren:</hi> Is not the World much altered in theſe days, when many great men will ſcarce acknowledg the poor people to be any of <hi>their kindred</hi> afar off, much leſs as <hi>brethren?</hi> Yea, this <hi>Governor,</hi> in theſe firſt and pureſt <hi>Times,</hi> did not only uſe the <hi>People</hi> as <hi>brethren,</hi> but as <hi>children, he carryed them in his boſom, neer his heart,</hi> (and tenderly too) <hi>as ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing children;</hi> and that alſo by <hi>Gods own direction,</hi> as <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf witneſſeth, and willingly acknowledgeth: But when <hi>Kings obtained the Government,</hi> we may obſerve how ſoon the caſe was altered, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bimelech</hi> he <hi>ſlayeth his brethren,</hi> that he might <hi>obtain the preeminence;</hi> and <hi>Saul</hi> he <hi>perſecuted an innocent and vertuous man,</hi> fearing leſt he might hinder <hi>his ſon from reigning after him;</hi> yea he purſueth <hi>this</hi> with ſuch <hi>violence</hi> that he maketh <hi>little account</hi> of <hi>Gods Commandments, if they ſtand in his way to hinder him to make ſure the Government to his ſon Jonathan,</hi> blood is not much valued in his ſight, witneſs the death of <hi>Gods Prieſts,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22.19. <hi>And Nob, the City of the Prieſts, ſmote he with the edg of the ſword, both man and woman, both childe and ſuckling, both Ox, and Aſs, and ſheep with the edg of the ſword;</hi> and <hi>Davids</hi> life, which he earneſtly ſought: Witneſs <hi>his unjust mole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation of the People,</hi> whom he forced from <hi>their own dwellings</hi> to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:117747:64"/> an <hi>innocent and good man:</hi> Theſe were ſome of the firſt fruits of <hi>their Kings,</hi> more followed afterwards; But thus it was not the <hi>practiſe</hi> of <hi>theſe Judges</hi> in the firſt and pureſt <hi>Times.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But further we may note, That this man <hi>Moſes</hi> and his ſucceſſors (to the days of <hi>Samuel</hi>) ſuch as <hi>God inſtituted</hi> (I do not mean ſuch as <hi>crept in at the windows, and in by-paths,</hi> not in the way <hi>God inſtituted</hi>) but <hi>Moſes</hi> and the reſt of his ſucceſſors to <hi>Samuel,</hi> we read much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded concerning <hi>their vertues, their pains, and diligence,</hi> but we do not read that they addicted themſelves <hi>to gather great Eſtates to leave to their children</hi> (and ſuch as they had <hi>fleeced from their brethren the People unjuſtly</hi>) nor do we read much of <hi>their banqueting houſes,</hi> nor of <hi>their ſumptuous palaces,</hi> nor of <hi>their numerous ſervants,</hi> nor of <hi>their hunting and hawking,</hi> nor of <hi>their excerable ſwearing and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheming the great and glorious Name of the Lord,</hi> nor of <hi>their Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives Royal, to overtop and annihilate Gods Commandments,</hi> and <hi>to ſeize upon the wracks of poor diſtreſſed Merchants and Seamen,</hi> which ſuffered ſhipwrack upon their borders; a cuſtom, I beleeve, hateful and abominable in the eyes of the Lord, and directly in oppoſition to his Commands, who commandeth us <hi>to help and relieve the oppreſſed and afflicted, and not to ſtrive to add to their afflictions, by taking away that little that God had otherwiſe ſpared to them.</hi> (I heard of one ſhip ſince my arrival, that the people ſeeing themſelves in danger, forſook the ſhip, yet after this ſhip was ſo brought to the ſhore, that much of the loading (being rich, and of value) was ſaved from the violence of the Sea, but not returned to the Owners<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that I could yet learn:) I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly entreat you that are our Governors, make <hi>diligent enquiry,</hi> that no more ſuch crying ſins be commited, leſt it bring upon us the <hi>fierce wrath of the Lord.</hi>) But to return; Neither are theſe Judges noted to keep a company about them of <hi>ſwearers</hi> or <hi>other vicious perſons,</hi> ſuch as I here name not, but ſuch as your ears have heard of, and ſuch as God abominateth. Theſe Judges, in <hi>theſe firſt and pureſt Times,</hi> were <hi>humble, faithful, watchful, and pious men,</hi> men whoſe acts are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded by Gods <hi>direction</hi> to all <hi>generations,</hi> that they might be <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples</hi> to follow.</p>
            <p>[O Lord,] ſhall we ever live to ſee thoſe, (or ſuch as thoſe Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors that were in thoſe <hi>first and pureſt times?</hi>) Haſt thou given us hope of ſuch a <hi>Reformation?</hi> Bleſſed be thy Name; I beleeve thou haſt promiſed, that we ſhall have <hi>Judges as at the firſt, and Counſellers
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:117747:65"/> as at the beginning; then ſhall we be called a City of righteouſneſs, a faithful City.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having ſpoken thus much (although it be very much leſs then the <hi>ſcripture</hi> recordeth for our learning) touching the <hi>qualifications &amp; vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of theſe Judges</hi> in <hi>theſe firſt and pureſt times,</hi> wherein God did the moſt eminently and the moſt immediatly appoint and preſcribe <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Governors,</hi> to and for his <hi>Church,</hi> and peculiarly choſen peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <hi>Iſrael;</hi> I ſhall now endeavor to propound to conſideration (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the meaſure of grace received) to draw out of Gods ſacred Word what finde there recorded concerning the <hi>principal Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors</hi> and other <hi>Governors</hi> diſtributed in <hi>ſeveral adminiſtrations,</hi> and alſo <hi>their power and limitations,</hi> and alſo <hi>the entrance of them into their places.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I finde, <hi>That God, in his divine wiſdom, ſaw it meet for his Church, and choſen, and peculiar people, to ordain, inſtitute, and appoint one chief Judg, and not many:</hi> Thus it appeareth in the book of <hi>Exodus,</hi> and in the records of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> &amp; of all the <hi>Judges,</hi> and in the book of the <hi>Kings, that one chief Judg had the charge:</hi> for although <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> were divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, it is there to be noted, that afterwards they became as two diſtinct and differenced Governments: and alſo we note, that this was not ſo in <hi>thoſe firſt and pureſt times,</hi> wherein God did the moſt immediately and clearly appoint <hi>Government:</hi> And alſo we may obſerve, <hi>That this diviſion did not ſtrengthen them, nor did it turn to their peace and welfare,</hi> as afterwards appeared, and is recorded in the Books of the <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Chronicles;</hi> For although God ſuffered it to be ſo, yet we may alſo conſider, <hi>That God ſuffereth, and bringeth upon the people for their ſins, many tryals and afflictions, which yet God knoweth how to make uſe of for his own glory:</hi> This people would not keep within the bounds of Gods <hi>firſt inſtitutions,</hi> therefore God cauſeth them to ſee the difference of <hi>Government,</hi> to ſee the difference between his <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions and inſtitutions,</hi> and their own <hi>inventions:</hi> and alſo, that God might ſhew the fruits of ſuch irregular proceedings to us that ſhould come in theſe latter times; <hi>Whatſoever was written, was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten for our learning:</hi> Conſidering this, I dare not turn aſide from Gods Commandments in <hi>thoſe firſt and pureſt times,</hi> wherein <hi>God</hi> appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>that there ſhould be one Governor, and but one as chief.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that this is the beſt way of <hi>Government,</hi> moſt for <hi>Gods</hi> glory, and the peoples good, theſe Reaſons guide me thereunto.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Becauſe <hi>God</hi> in his wiſdom did ſee meet that it ſhould be ſo;
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:117747:65"/> witneſs the <hi>immediate pattern</hi> God gave to the people, <hi>Moſes, Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua, Gideon, Samuel,</hi> and the reſt.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Becauſe this is the <hi>pattern</hi> of <hi>that glorious Government in Heaven,</hi> one <hi>God</hi> diſtinguiſhed, but not divided in three perſons, which governeth over all. <hi>God</hi> inviteth us to be like to himſelf, and ſeteth forth himſelf for us to imitate; <hi>Be ye holy, for I am holy,</hi> ſaith the Lord, (a place well known,) From hence I conclude, <hi>That that Government is beſt that is most like, moſt conformable, to Gods Government in Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, We know that Forces united are ſtrongeſt, and occaſion leſs difference and diſcord: We may ſee in the Records of our own Nation the many Troubles, Wars, and Diſcords that many ſeveral <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments</hi> brought forth and produced. If men ſhould commit the conſtant <hi>Government</hi> of a Land into many hands of <hi>equal authority,</hi> call them by what names you will, would not this be the iſſue and fruits thereof? Firſt, They ſhould turn from the firſt and moſt pure way preſcribed by God, (which God forbid:) And alſo would not ſuch Governors be themſelves over burthened with buſineſs? and would not the <hi>People be worn away, wearied and oppreſſed thereby?</hi> It was <hi>Jethroes</hi> counſel to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Lord allowed or approved of it, namely, that there is recorded, <hi>Exo.</hi> 18.18. <hi>Thou both wearieſt thy ſelf and this people that is with thee.</hi> Verſ. 21. <hi>Provide thou among all the people men of courage, fearing God, men dealing truly, and ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>We may there note, That <hi>this distribution of Justice into many hands</hi> was not to the intent that many ſhould judg ordinarily in every one caſe, for then it would have brought both a <hi>greater burthen</hi> upon <hi>Moſes,</hi> and upon the people, becauſe when the <hi>judgment of a cauſe</hi> goeth through many hands, theſe many hands, or Judges, are with more difficulty brought together, and with <hi>greater charge, greater expences;</hi> and likewiſe <hi>their judgments</hi> not eaſily reconciled: And alſo ſuch caſes, in ſuch a manner heard, are longer in iſſuing, fewer cauſes can be heard, and likewiſe the people will be burthened with <hi>long waiting,</hi> and <hi>great expences</hi> to maintain <hi>this ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rge:</hi> Therefore there were not more <hi>Moſes's</hi> added, not more Governors of <hi>equal authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> to aſſiſt <hi>Moſes</hi> in the hearing ſuch cauſes as came ordinarily to be judged by him: But it is evident, That <hi>this multiplying Judges</hi> was to that end, <hi>that theſe Judges, or Rulers, being choſen, might be diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:117747:66"/> into the ſeverall Tribes where the People lived,</hi> to the intent that the People might not travell far, but might have <hi>their cauſes</hi> tryed and judged near to their own <hi>habitations.</hi> And this did not weaken, or leſſen, nor diminiſh from <hi>Moſes</hi> his authority, there was this ſtill reſerved, that <hi>Moſes</hi> the chief Judge ſhould ſtill have the ſole <hi>judgement and determination of the weightieſt matters and affaires.</hi> This further appeareth by the extent of <hi>Ioſhua</hi> his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, <hi>Ioſhua</hi> 1.16, 17. <hi>Then they anſwered Ioſhua ſaying, all that thou commandeſt us we will do, and whitherſoever thou ſendeſt us we will go: as we obeyed Moſes in all things, ſo we will obey thee: onely the Lord thy God be with thee as he was with Moſes.</hi> Ver. 18. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall rebell againſt thy Commandement: and will not obey thy Words, in all that thou commandeſt him, let him be put to death, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here it may be noted that the <hi>chiefe judge or governor,</hi> that was over Gods heritage, had power to command and to determine all the <hi>weightieſt matters</hi> that concerned <hi>the people of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If we looke but upon a <hi>Family,</hi> (which repreſenteth a <hi>little common-wealth</hi>) wee ſhall there finde that God appointed one <hi>chiefe governor:</hi> (although the woman be in ſuch a relation) yet God knew that it was meete to ordaine one to be <hi>chiefe governor,</hi> whoſe word ſhould be of force. This doth avoide much contention, where it is willingly conſented unto by all in the Family. But on the contrary where the wife (which is the neareſt relation and the moſt eminent in the <hi>Family</hi> next to the man) doth contend for the gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of all <hi>matters</hi> in the Family, What <hi>ſad events</hi> do follow in ſuch caſes? That mutuall love that otherwiſe would be betweene the Man, and the Woman, is ſeparated, the Family diſturbed, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and children grieved, neighbours offended, and God much diſhonored. Even ſo and much more (I believe) we ſhall finde the <hi>Common-wealth</hi> to be diſturbed, where no one is chiefe.</p>

               <hi>Object.</hi> But is it not ſaid, <hi>that in the multitude of counſellors there is ſafety?</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> That ſheweth that the <hi>chiefe governor</hi> ſhould not be ſo proudly lift up in his ſpirit, that he ſhould deſpiſe the advice of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, in which reſpect <hi>David</hi> ſheweth an <hi>humble frame of heart,</hi> when he ſaith <hi>that hee will not reject the advice of his ſervant,</hi> much more not of thoſe that are in nearer relations. It is a precious vertue to be of an <hi>humble frame of heart, to hear the counſell of others:</hi> but this doth <hi>not</hi> deſtroy <hi>the lawful authority of Order in Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</hi>

            <pb n="131" facs="tcp:117747:66"/>
            <p>Touching <hi>Parliaments,</hi> or <hi>Aſſemblies of the Elders of the people</hi> doubtleſſe (I conceive) they may be, in diverſe caſes, as in the caſe of the defect and want of a <hi>chiefe Iudge,</hi> or in caſe that the <hi>chiefe Iudge</hi> ſhall degenerate and decline from the <hi>Inſtitutions</hi> and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements</hi> of God, they are ordained and approved of by God in ſuch caſes and in other caſes, provided that they do not diminiſh the <hi>power</hi> and <hi>lawfull authority</hi> that God doth allow to ſuch good <hi>governors</hi> that walke in his wayes. This appeareth by that <hi>quere</hi> that the Prophet <hi>Samuel</hi> maketh to the <hi>People,</hi> when he demandeth, 1 <hi>Samuel, whoſe Ox have I taken, or whoſe Aſſe have taken, or whom have J done wrong unto, or of whoſe hands have I taken any bribe to blind my eyes therewith?</hi> as if he ſhould have ſaid, <hi>if you could justly lay to my charge theſe things, there might be ſome just cauſe, wherefore you ſhould come together to demand another gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor (although neither would this warrant you to change the forme of government, for therein you ſhould breake Gods institution.)</hi> This appeareth likewiſe when the people aſſembled to depoſe and puniſh <hi>Athaliah,</hi> and divers others: &amp; the reaſon is plain, <hi>becauſe God must be honord above al, he is the ſupreme governor, &amp; ruler of rulers, &amp; people</hi>

            <p>Doubtleſſe <hi>that Law of God</hi> that bindeth all men (without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of perſons) <hi>to the obſervation of it,</hi> muſt of neceſſity finde a way, and allow a way <hi>for the obſervation of it,</hi> otherwiſe it would fall ſhort in the perfection of it; but to ſay <hi>that God onely must puniſh chiefe governors for their offences in another world,</hi> to me plainly appeareth to be of no validity, for God gave the Lawes to Men on Earth to be obſerved, and the breach of his Lawes to be puniſhed upon earth, without any <hi>reſpect of perſons</hi> or <hi>limitation, and one Law of God bindeth all men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to returne, <hi>that lawfull power, and authority, that God gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth; and hath beene given and yeelded to all good governors (by Gods Church and People) muſt doubtleſſe be yeelded to all good governors in like relations, and with the like reſpects:</hi> therefore I believe this is evident from the whole premiſed, <hi>that the principall governor of a Common-wealth must be one, and muſt have neither leſſe, nor more authority then Moſes and Ioſhua had, in thoſe firſt and pureſt times of Gods inſtitutions:</hi> And becauſe we have the like liberty to puniſh or to remove ſuch offenders as break the Law of God that they had: if we ſee that ſuch <hi>chiefe governors</hi> doe evidently act to <hi>Gods diſhonor,</hi> and the <hi>Peoples ruine,</hi> (which are unſeparable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions)
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:117747:67"/> Gods Laws do helpe the people, in caſe that God give the people hearts to improve them to his glory.</p>
            <p>Do but warily cleave to <hi>Gods ordinances, to his inſtitutions.</hi> Let the <hi>chiefeſt governor</hi> be ſubject to <hi>the puniſhment</hi> that God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribeth in ſuch caſes, for ſuch offences in <hi>his ſacred Word.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, take heede that God chuſe <hi>governors,</hi> let them be of his ſending, and this is of more <hi>validity,</hi> (then all the <hi>ties, fetters, charters, acts,</hi> and what ever <hi>inventions of man</hi>) to ſecure <hi>Gods glory,</hi> and <hi>the good of us, and of our posterity,</hi> (as I believe); for our dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and miſery ariſeth from this roote, namely, <hi>when governors creep in at the windowes, and in by-pathes,</hi> and are not indeed <hi>true Shepherds,</hi> but <hi>Wolves</hi> and <hi>Foxes:</hi> and ſhall we love them ſo well, that we ſhall take them by <hi>ſucceſſion;</hi> and not enquire of God, <hi>who ſhall be the man?</hi> thirdly, if we are yet more negligent, ſo that when they appeare to be (as they too often prove) <hi>Wolves in ſheepes clothing,</hi> yet do we obſerve <hi>Gods Lawes,</hi> which layeth ſuch open to puniſhment?</p>
            <p>The reaſon ſeemeth to me to be evident that cauſed the People, from time to time, to uſe ſuch paines, and diligence, to obtaine from former Kings, grants, that the Kings ſhould not oppreſſe, or tyrannize over the People, or their conſents to ſeverall ſuch Acts in <hi>Parliament;</hi> was it not becauſe <hi>the Law of God was kept in obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity?</hi> (the time fore determined by God, was not then accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed) who, or where was the man that durſt, or did ſo far ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, to declare the Law of God in that particular; namely <hi>that Kings were ſubject to the Law of God according to the true latitude of it;</hi> for had the Law of God bin fully, plainely, and clearely o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, the People might eaſily have ſeene, that they had had leſſe neede of ſuch promiſes, becauſe <hi>the Law of God is a more strong, a more cleare, and ſhining light, then all the Lawes of man whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</hi> And was not this the very grounds why it came to paſſe, that notwithſtanding all the <hi>grants</hi> that the People could obtaine from former Kings, they proved too weake to hold down their lofti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.

            </p>
            <p>Conſider another inſtance, if a <hi>Merchant</hi> or a <hi>great Tradeſman</hi> had many people to deal with all, by reaſon whereof he hath oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to imploy 20 or 40, men under him to diſpatch buſineſſe, theſe are not to the intent that they ſhall conſtantly act in every buſineſſe, for then (if they had all <hi>equall authority,</hi> no one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding in chief) they would one hinder another, and buſineſſe would go more ſlowly forward. Therefore the end why he calleth or taketh more men to helpe him, it is to the end that they may at once tend upon and diſpatch <hi>ſeverall occaſions,</hi> and alſo theſe are all of them to be ſubject to the <hi>Maſters order,</hi> and all the reſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly to be ſubject one to another. Thus did God ordain one <hi>Moſes</hi> chief governor to whom God committed <hi>the government,</hi> (which did nearly reſemble <hi>Gods government in Heaven</hi>) but through <hi>Mans weakeneſſe,</hi> (not being able to act like God) therefore God permitted <hi>Moſes</hi> to ordain <hi>other Rulers</hi> inferior to himſelf, and thoſe were diſtributed amongſt the People over <hi>thouſands</hi> and <hi>hundreds</hi> and <hi>fifties</hi> and <hi>tenns.</hi> Whereby it appeareth that the end was not that all thoſe <hi>rulers</hi> ſhould act, in the <hi>judgement</hi> of the <hi>ſame cauſes</hi>
               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:117747:68"/> that <hi>Moſes</hi> acted in. Neither were any of thoſe governors (much leſſe were they all) to have <hi>equall authority</hi> with <hi>Moſes.</hi> This did further appear by <hi>the authority</hi> that all the <hi>Iudges of Iſrael</hi> had ſucceſſively.</p>
            <p>I doe but labout to ſet before you, theſe inſtances; and it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I am not like (ſo far as I know) to have any more opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in this World to ſpeak in the cauſe, blame me not therefore if I propound theſe things to your conſideration, for I and my po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity are like to be ſubject to what <hi>forme of government,</hi> you eſtabliſh, and I evidently ſee that from <hi>Government</hi> will ariſe <hi>great bleſſings</hi> (if it be ſuch <hi>government</hi> as God approveth, if it be ſuch as God hath preſcribed) then I know that the <hi>bleſſed Spirit of God</hi> will reſt upon ſuch governors.</p>
            <p>On the contrary I know that if you miſtake in <hi>government.</hi> I do expect that <hi>great afflictions</hi> will follow, and <hi>Governors</hi> not entring into their places according to <hi>the Rule of Gods Word,</hi> I ſhall not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that the gracious Preſence of God, will accompany them, And this I evidently ſee (by the records of the <hi>Sacred Word of God,</hi> and by the <hi>experience of all Ages</hi> recorded) <hi>that where government is corrupted, they are a meanes to draw the People from the ſincere wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, and they are a meanes to bring the Wrath of God upon the People:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I doubt not but there are amongſt you many wiſe, godly, and men precious in Gods eſteem, I pray God double the Spirit of his grace upon you; and direct you to ſee much more of Gods minde, however let it not be grievous, if I put you in minde of thoſe things which you know, and which are plainely recorded in Gods ſacred Word. <hi>Moſes</hi> put the People in minde of the ſame things often, and ſo did <hi>Ioſhua,</hi> and ſo did <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles.</hi> This is all that I can do by all the inſtances or arguments I can alledge, it is but only to perſwade, or put you in minde of what is already recorded, plainly in Gods Word which is a <hi>bright ſhining light;</hi> all that I can ſay, (in compariſon of Gods ſacred Word) is far ſhort of the <hi>darkeſt night,</hi> compared to the <hi>brighteſt ſhining light of the day,</hi> therefore all that draweth me, (or is any motive to me) in this cauſe, is this, namely, <hi>The records of the ſacred Scriptures ſhew ſuch a Government, and ſuch Governors, God did preſcribe, in ſuch a manner, and they were bleſſed by God, they were a bleſſing to the People, and the holy, good, and bleſſed ſpirit of God was given to ſuch.

            <p>On the contrary I have obſerved (both from <hi>the Records of the ſacred Scriptures,</hi> and from <hi>the Records of all Ages,</hi> and from <hi>well conſidered experience</hi>) that although <hi>the inventions of men,</hi> which ſwerve from the moſt approved Rules of Gods Word, may have a faire ſhew in ſome mens eyes, yet he that well noteth ſuch inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhall in the iſſue finde <hi>Gall and Wormewood, bitter fruits,</hi> and Gods good Spirit doth not accompany ſuch inventions, which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth me to keepe a loofe from <hi>Mans inventions,</hi> eſpecially in ſuch a <hi>weighty matter,</hi> and of ſo <hi>great, eminent and high concernment,</hi> both for <hi>Gods glory,</hi> and for <hi>the Peoples bleſſedneſſe.</hi> I conceive we cannot poſſible be too circumſpect, nor cleave too cloſe and ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly, to <hi>the moſt approved and bleſſed forme of Government, and Governors</hi> preſcribed, owned, and bleſſed by God, and recorded in the <hi>ſacred Scriptures,</hi> for our learning.

            <p>But further, where there are many <hi>Iudges</hi> of equall <hi>authority</hi> (though Men fearing God, and ſeeking Gods glory) yet in many, or in ſome cauſes, and moſt eſpecially in the moſt weighty cauſes, do not reſpects ſway much?

<pb n="137" facs="tcp:117747:69"/> way to avoide confuſion and contention, and moſt like to be bleſſed. Herein indeed will lie <hi>the great weight of all the matter,</hi> namely, <hi>that we cleave cloſe to Gods Rules.</hi> that ſo a Wolfe may be preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for getting into the ſheepe fold. For let us but ſeeke God in thoſe wayes he hath appointed ſeriouſly, and heartily, and (I doubt not but that) we ſhall obtaine a <hi>bleſſing,</hi> a <hi>Man ſent of God.</hi> And then let us never fear, but God will accompany ſuch a man, with <hi>his bleſſed Spirit.</hi> Did ever a People ſeeke GOD humbly (follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing GODS <hi>Rules</hi>) and heartily, and failed? I believe no Record of <hi>Divine authority</hi> will demonſtrate ſuch an example, in ſuch a cauſe, ſo proſecuted.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>But was not this forme of government, peculiar to the ſtate of the Iſraelites, is it not aboliſhed, at the comming of Kings?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I deſire every one that doth unfeignedly deſire to do Gods Will to be wary of <hi>this Objection,</hi> and conſider that it is too much for us to turn aſide from <hi>Gods Inſtitutions;</hi> but to deny <hi>Gods Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions,</hi> this is a ſin of a <hi>deep impreſſion.</hi> How often doth GOD bid us <hi>beware that we do neither add, nor diminiſh?</hi> this being duly conſidered I anſwer.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>this Order of government by Iudges,</hi> in this manner, was Gods owne Order. God did moſt immediately appoint this Order.</p>
            <p>Secondly, God did preſcribe this, to his <hi>Church and People,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Law was given. <hi>Moſes</hi> was appoin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>this order of government</hi> was continued, confirmed, and bleſſed immediately by God himſelf und<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r the Law.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, this O der was further confirmed by GOD, when the People in the Dayes of <hi>Samuel</hi> deſired a <hi>Government by Kings,</hi> which appeareth in that GOD plainely affirmeth, <hi>that the People caſt God off when they altered this forme:</hi> and further it appeareth <hi>that God was the ſame long after,</hi> by the expreſſions of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, there was never any <hi>Government</hi> ſince<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to this Day, to be compared with <hi>this Government,</hi> nor ſo bleſſed by God, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by the Records of the <hi>Chronicles,</hi> and the bookes of the <hi>Kings of Iſrael,</hi> and <hi>Iuda:</hi> to which we may add the <hi>experiments of all Ages.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="138" facs="tcp:117747:70"/>
            <p>Sixthly, Gods Wiſdome is moſt perfect, and God is unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, this Order was never repealed in any Age to this day.</p>
            <p>Eighthly, the Promiſes of God in the <hi>Scripture,</hi> do plainely ſhew that when <hi>God will have mercy upon his beloved People,</hi> it ſhall be ſhewed the moſt eminently, and apparently, by <hi>reſtoring Iudges as at the firſt, and counſellors as at the beginning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ninthly, this <hi>government</hi> by one <hi>chiefe</hi> as <hi>head and governor</hi> doth the neareſt reſemble, that <hi>Heavenly frame of government.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tenthly, conſider who ever thou art that harboureſt ſuch thoughts, <hi>that ſuch thoughts do ariſe from unſound Principles,</hi> I believe, <hi>not well ballanced conſiderations.</hi> Becauſe admit or ſuppoſe thou were left at liberty, now to preſcribe a <hi>forme of government,</hi> what <hi>forme of Government</hi> couldeſt thou invent? Conſider that God wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed evidently and eminently, that (when God preſcribed govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by Judges (in ſuch order as Divine records do mention) <hi>this forme</hi> was better then any <hi>other Nation,</hi> had in the whole World. <hi>No Nation was ſo bleſſed by God in thoſe times that had Lawes and Ordinances ſo righteous</hi> (by which is meant <hi>Governors or Iudges,</hi> and Lawes to be their Rules) as God in <hi>thoſe firſt and pureſt times did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to his firſt borne Son.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And further conſider, <hi>that we are not now a ſeparated People from the true Iſrael of God, we are not ſtrangers to thoſe Lawes which God, then in thoſe times, gave to them;</hi> but contrarily <hi>we by Faith in Ieſus Chriſt, are ingrafted into the true Olive Tree,</hi> we now are <hi>part of Gods houſhould, and doe ſubject to all the Lawes of Gods first borne Sonne,</hi> and though they were <hi>our elder brethren,</hi> yet now alſo <hi>God hath,</hi> in his rich abundant, and not to be ſufficiently expreſſed mercy, <hi>begotten us alſo to a lively hope,</hi> ſo that we alſo are <hi>their yonger Brethren.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore for any man to conceive, that he could invent a <hi>better forme of government,</hi> then any in the World in thoſe times had, and a <hi>better forme of government,</hi> then God himſelfe did the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately preſcribe, and own, and confirm, and bleſſe; ſuch a man (if there be any ſuch) had neede to conſider this matter firſt very ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſedly; leaſt wanting wiſdom, to preſcribe and power to uphould, and power to bleſſe and proſper ſuch his inventions, he ſhould be found to be an oppoſer of God himſelf, and likewiſe exalt his wiſdom above the wiſdom of God.</p>
            <pb n="139" facs="tcp:117747:70"/>
            <p>The next matter I conceive it will be meete to propound to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration; other judges or governors, that are in order inferior to this <hi>chiefe Judge</hi> before mentioned. Exod. 18.25. <hi>And Moſes choſe Men of courage out of all Iſrael and made them heads over the People, Rulers over thouſands, Rulers over hundreds, Rulers over fifties, and Rulers over tens,</hi> Ver. 26. <hi>and they judged the People at all ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, but they brought the hard cauſes to Moſes, for they Iudged all ſmall matters themſelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The end wherefore <hi>judgement</hi> or <hi>Iudges</hi> were thus diſtributed, is to that intent, that both the <hi>chiefe governor</hi> may not be over burdened, nor the People over burdened, recorded <hi>Exod.</hi> 18.18. <hi>Thou both wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieſt thy ſelfe, and this People that is with thee greatly:</hi> the end being duly conſidered, we may more eaſily diſtribute the governors: Governors are ſutable to this proportion to be diſtributed into the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall <hi>Shiers, Cities, Townes,</hi> and <hi>Places,</hi> where the <hi>People</hi> live. (which plainely appeareth the end being conſidered) for the very <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> of a <hi>loving Father</hi> is ſo prevalent, that <hi>love</hi> cauſeth him to ſeek the <hi>comfort of his children,</hi> and to provide for <hi>their comforts,</hi> and <hi>conveniences;</hi> to this purpoſe the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>that he is worſe then an Infidell that provideth not for his Family.</hi> Now conſider that the <hi>Common-wealth</hi> in ſome reſpect, is the <hi>Family</hi> of the <hi>chiefe Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is a lamentable caſe to conſider, have not the People bin, (I could wiſh it were not ſo ſtill) forced to travell many miles, to their great detriment, for to get thoſe cauſes decided, and determined, that might with much eaſe, have bin ended at, or near to their own dwellings. Yea moreover have they obtained the determining or ending of their cauſes, without making many or diverſe ſuch chargable journies, to the <hi>undoing of too many Men, Widdowes, and poore Fatherleſſe Children;</hi> have not many for want of means, bin forced to looſe <hi>their rights,</hi> and <hi>lawfull maintenance?</hi> Conſider of it dear <hi>Fathers,</hi> and now let it be remedied, and doubtleſſe God will ſhortly ſay unto you, <hi>well done good and faithfull ſervant thou haſt beene faithfull in theſe things, come be ruler over more and better things, enter into thy Maſters joy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But on the contrary conſider that <hi>oppreſſion</hi> is a crying ſinne, God will certainely hear <hi>the cry of the oppreſſed, the cry of old, and yong, the cry of the Widdowes, and of the Orphanes,</hi> God will certainely hear them, God will do it, for <hi>the Mouth of the Lord hath spoken
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:117747:71"/> it.</hi> Therefore dearly beloved <hi>Fathers,</hi> I humbly beſeech you let <hi>Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors</hi> be diſtr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And keep cloſe to the rules preſcribed in <hi>theſe firſt and pureſt times;</hi> namely, <hi>let the determination of cauſes be in proportion, to theſe firſt patterns, let not the end be neglected, which is, that Gods Lawes be obſerved, and the People may be eaſed.</hi> I pray you to conſider what is recorded concerning <hi>Samuel,</hi> that good and pious <hi>Governor,</hi> he, rather then the People ſhould travell far, did travell himſelf to the places where the People dwelt. 1 Sam. 7.16. <hi>And Samuel went about yeare by yeare to Bethell, and Gilgall, and Miſpeh and judged Iſrael in all thoſe places.</hi> No doubt he appointed Judges all over the Land, that did judge the people l kewiſe.

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, in one and the ſame cauſe, I believe, it will not be ſo much for the Peoples comfort, not ſo ſutable to <hi>the firſt and moſt pure inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> and, I believe, t will be too great a burden to thoſe that ſhould be <hi>Governors,</hi> in ſuch cauſes, in ſuch a manner conſtantly.</p>
            <p>I do conceive that from that end of the <hi>multiplying Governors,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded <hi>Exod.</hi> 18. which was to eaſe the <hi>People,</hi> and <hi>Moſes,</hi> and that Gods Commandments might not be broken; and from the acting and preſident that <hi>Moſes</hi> left there recorded, it appeareth, that <hi>many gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors are needfull in their ſeverall places,</hi> but not many <hi>governors of equal authority,</hi> conſtantly to act in one cauſe, and not in the weightieſt cauſes more and moſt eſpecially.

Num. 27.18. <hi>And the Lord ſaid unto Moſes take Ioſhua the ſonne of Nun in whom is the ſpirit, and put thine hands upon him, &amp;c.</hi> VVe may note here that in the Verſes before, <hi>Moſes</hi> did earneſtly intreat God, that he would appoint a <hi>Governor,</hi> or <hi>Shepherd,</hi> to go in and out before the people; <hi>Moſes</hi> knowing of what concernment it was to Gods glory and the peoples good, <hi>that the people ſhould have a good ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd,</hi> note that God doth not preſently anſwer <hi>Moſes</hi> thus, <hi>let the people chuſe a Governor themſelves;</hi> but on the contrary, God owneth this way, of his own preſcribing, as appeareth, becauſe as God did immediately chuſe <hi>Moſes,</hi> as is before conſidered, ſo alſo here again God proceedeth as before, and doth immediately chuſe <hi>Ioſhua,</hi> to be the chief <hi>governor of his people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſecondly we may obſerve, that God giveth this further ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of his minde, in theſe wordes, <hi>in whom is the ſpirit,</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and whereby God ſheweth, that the People might have erred if they had choſen, for they could ſee but the outward man. But God knew exactly who would be for his glory and for the peoples good, he knew in whom his bleſſed ſpirit was. Next reade <hi>Judges</hi> 1.1. <hi>After that Joſhua was dead the children of Iſrael aſked the Lord ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, who ſhall goe up for us, againſt the Canaanites.</hi> VVe may here note, that the people had bin ſo well inſtructed in the dayes of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Ioſhua,</hi> that they did account it to be Gods Will, and their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>to let God chuſe their chiefe Governor;</hi> no doubt this people did not do this unadviſedly, but upon <hi>knowledge,</hi> and due <hi>conſideration,</hi> that it was <hi>the Will of God;</hi> and that it was the moſt ſureſt, and ſafeſt way for them, <hi>that God ſhould chuſe their principall Governor for them.</hi> Therefore they uſed the means, they enquired Gods minde <hi>who ſhould governe them.</hi> And it is to be duly conſidered that this People (nor any of their poſterity) did never ſeek God in ſuch weighty Cauſes, Humbly, Heartily, Earneſtly, but God did uſually, moſtly, if not alwayes, condeſcend unto them, and anſwer them graciouſly, whether they enquired Gods Mind by the judgment of <hi>Vrim,</hi> or whether by <hi>lotts,</hi> I cannot tell; but God anſwered both
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:117747:72"/> theſe wayes, and <hi>God owned and preſcribed both theſe wayes;</hi> as appeareth by <hi>Samuel</hi> his practice in chuſing <hi>Saul</hi> by Gods immediate direction. 1 Sam, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>VVe may note further, that the people are <hi>recorded by God,</hi> to be a people that did cleave cloſe to, and were obſervant of, Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, Joſu. 24.31. <hi>And Iſrael ſerved the Lord all the dayes of Ioſhua, and all the dayes of the Elders that overlived Joſhua, and had known all the workes of the Lord, which hee had done for Iſrael.</hi> We may note that after this Generation, <hi>the people grew wanton and forſooke the ſtreight, and pure wayes of the Lord; therefore the Lord delivered them into the hands of their enemies, Judg,</hi> 2.12, 13.14. But the way that God helpeth them, is by raiſing up Judges, <hi>Judg.</hi> 2.16. <hi>Reade Judges</hi> 3.9. <hi>And the children of Iſrael cryed unto the Lord, and the Lord ſtirred up a Saviour to the children of Iſrael, and he ſaved them,</hi> Ver. 10. <hi>And the Spirit of the Lord came upon him, and he judged Iſrael.</hi> Here we may note, that it is not a vaine thing to ſeek the Lord, for although the people had done wickedly, yet when they cryed unto the Lord, the Lord heareth them.</p>
            <p>And ſecondly, we may note, that God owneth this way; that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf chuſeth <hi>Government</hi> immediately. Thus we may read that God did immediately ſend <hi>Gideon.</hi> Judg. 6.14. <hi>And the Lord looked upon him and ſaid, go in this thy might, and thou ſhalt ſave Iſrael, have not I ſent thee.</hi> I note that where God doth immediately ſend, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point <hi>government</hi> from the dayes of <hi>Moſes,</hi> to the dayes of <hi>Samuel</hi> God doth not inſtitute or appoint the Son, to ſucceed in <hi>Government,</hi> next after the Fathers death; and this continued all the time of thoſe <hi>firſt and pureſt times,</hi> and thoſe times wherein God did moſt imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately appoint <hi>Government</hi> in <hi>favour,</hi> and in <hi>mercy,</hi> to his <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>People.</hi> Whereby it plainly appeareth that ſucceſſion from the Father, to the Son, was none of Gods inſtitution, <hi>in thoſe firſt and pureſt Times.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God choſe <hi>Samuel</hi> to be <hi>Governor,</hi> or <hi>cheife Governor</hi> immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately; by which (and by the former <hi>Governors</hi> mentioned before) it plainly appeareth <hi>that God did preſcribe, and owne, and bleſſe this way,</hi> it appeareth that it was Gods <hi>minde,</hi> and <hi>will,</hi> to chuſe <hi>Governors</hi> himſelf immediately. The next way that God did preſcribe of chuſing <hi>governors,</hi> was by <hi>lot;</hi> whereby <hi>God</hi> did immediately chuſe the chief <hi>governor,</hi> recorded, 1 Sam. 10.19. <hi>Now therefore ſtand you here before the Lord according to your Tribes, and according to your thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands.</hi>
               <pb n="143" facs="tcp:117747:72"/> Verſ. 20. <hi>And when Samuel had gathered together all the Tribes of Iſrael, the Tribe of Benjamin was taken, and afterwards he aſſembled the Tribe of Benjamin according to their families, and the family of Matri was taken, ſo Saul the ſon of Kiſh was taken; and Samuel ſaid, See ye not him whom the Lord hath choſen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this place it plainly appeareth, That God did ordain this way for the chuſing the <hi>principal Governor</hi> namely by <hi>lots,</hi> whereby God is ſaid to chuſe. There were ſome Judges, the manner of whoſe choyce is not ſo expreſly recorded (thoſe moſt eminent) are ſuch as God firſt raiſed up, and uſed as <hi>inſtruments in more then an ordinary manner;</hi> ſuch, for ought I know, may be made uſeful for Gods glory, and for the peoples good, ſuch as God hath raiſed up to work <hi>deliverances for the people,</hi> ſuch as (in that reſpect) may be called <hi>Saviours,</hi> and ſuch as are men well known to be men of <hi>courage, humility, and p ety:</hi> We find, That God afforded <hi>deliverances, protection,</hi> and <hi>peace to the people,</hi> by ſuch men as, for ought I know, were ſo raiſed up; this way is the neareſt to theſe moſt pure and immediate callings of <hi>Governors</hi> by God to their places in thoſe firſt and pureſt times. But this is not ſo ſafe and clear a way, (ſo far as I underſtand:)</p>
            <p>Firſt, Becauſe we read not, we cannot find it recorded, (that I can find, and I have ſearched the Scripture with diligence,) <hi>that God did appoint the people to chuſe that way:</hi> Conſider, That thoſe acts that the people did, are not therefore <hi>Gods Commandments</hi> and <hi>Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> for then we muſt follow them in many actions, which would be vain to conceive.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The People may err, and are much ſubject ſo to do.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Gods Law is expreſs, <hi>we may not add nor diminiſh, we may not turn to the right nor to the left hand, to or from Gods Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, I believe the <hi>promiſes of God</hi> lead us to chuſe moſt exactly, according to the <hi>pureſt Inſtitutions,</hi> noted in <hi>Iſai.</hi> 1. <hi>I will</hi> (that is, God will) <hi>reſtore thy Judges as at the firſt, &amp;c.</hi> that holdeth out <hi>as in the pureſt times, &amp;c.</hi> Before I make <hi>Application</hi> of what is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, touching <hi>the calling of theſe chief Judges,</hi> I conceive it will be needful to anſwer an <hi>Objection,</hi> which is this:</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>May not the people chuſe chief Governors? did not the people chuſe Jepthtah?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The exact manner of <hi>Jepthtah's</hi> choyce is not ſo plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, but that, for ought I know, they might have ſome further en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:117747:73"/> then is ſet down; much we read not of <hi>Jephthahs</hi> acts, this is to be noted concerning him, That he did ſuch an act as no other Judg did, (that we re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d of,) namely, he vowed ſuch an unllimited and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful vow, as occaſioned him to <hi>ſacrifice his daughter,</hi> (and ſo he did) which was the direct breach of <hi>Gods Command</hi> in a high degree.</p>
            <p>But ſecondly, conſider, <hi>That it is a ſafe way in dubious matters,</hi> (eſpecially in ſuch <hi>eminent matters</hi> as do ſo immediately concern <hi>Gods glory,</hi> and the <hi>peoples good) to walk by the plaineſt, by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he moſt evident ways that God hath preſcribed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. God ſaith expreſly with many <hi>threatnings,</hi> and many times, <hi>That we ſhall neither add nor diminiſh from his Institutions:</hi> Now this is evident, That God chuſing immediately either by <hi>voyce,</hi> by <hi>Prophet,</hi> or by <hi>lot,</hi> is Gods own appointment, It is without denyal or queſtion: and God foreſeeing that the people would corrupt their ways, and break his <hi>Inſtitutions,</hi> by deſiring to be <hi>governed by Kings,</hi> yet God was ſo <hi>jealous of his honor,</hi> and <hi>tender of the peoples good,</hi> in the choyce of the <hi>chief Governors,</hi> that he ſaith expreſly, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. <hi>Thou ſhalt make him King whom the Lord thy God ſhall chuſe:</hi> Therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that we may neither add nor diminiſh, it is without compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon much ſafer to <hi>chuſe by Gods plain Rules:</hi> For in both the <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by Judges,</hi> and in the <hi>Government by Kings,</hi> it is to be noted, That God did immediately chuſe <hi>Governors;</hi> and I cannot ſee that a people that will follow <hi>Gods expreſs Command and Preſident,</hi> can avoyd but that God (and not men) muſt chuſe the <hi>chief Governor:</hi> It is expreſſed and recorded, <hi>That God raiſed up Judges, and made them Saviours to the people;</hi> but becauſe the manner how God raiſed them up, is not ſo plainly expreſſed, therefore (I conceive) that it is the ſafeſt way to follow the plaineſt and cleareſt ways, by which are plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declared, <hi>the manner how God did chuſe, and wherein God did act, own, and moſt eminently bleſs;</hi> but where God raiſeth up men, and maketh them <hi>eminent Instruments for his glory,</hi> and by them work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>deliverance to a people,</hi> in ſuch a caſe I dare not oppoſe it, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, I believe, it is a way neareſt to <hi>Gods immediate callings,</hi> and neareſt to the <hi>plaineſt Preſidents recorded in the ſacred Scriptures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, If the people chuſe, <hi>they are ſubject to err and miſtake,</hi> they ſee but <hi>the outward appearance,</hi> and they may intend <hi>one man,</hi> and it may be a great number carryeth the choyce to <hi>another,</hi> or they may be miſtaken in <hi>the man moſt meet for Government,</hi> which will appear, if we conſider, that <hi>Samuel,</hi> a wiſe and holy man, was miſtaken
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:117747:73"/> in chuſing but amongſt one mans children, how much ſooner may we be miſtaken, when we, having leſs underſtanding then <hi>Samuel,</hi> are to chuſe out of a <hi>multitude,</hi> and we may be over-powered by <hi>money,</hi> by <hi>friends,</hi> by <hi>kindred,</hi> by <hi>beauty,</hi> by <hi>eloquence,</hi> by <hi>fraud,</hi> or <hi>force,</hi> or ways we know not of.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Experience may teach us, <hi>That people do err very often, and chuſe thoſe men to be their Judges or Governors, that prove di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect enemies to them and to their poſterity;</hi> witneſs <hi>Abimeleck,</hi> and a multitude of others, recorded for our <hi>learning,</hi> and for our <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sixthly, God never erreth, and he doth bleſs with his holy Spirit men of his own ſending.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, God complainenth of this by his Prophets, formerly cited, ſaying, <hi>They had Kings, but not by me; Princes, but I knew it not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From the premiſſes may be gathered three ways, <hi>whereby Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors were in thoſe first and pureſt times choſen and ordained;</hi> two of them are very clear, the third I dare not abſolutely oppoſe, but leave it to the conſideration of the <hi>godly-wiſe-hearted:</hi> I ſhall propound to conſideration ſomewhat touching the <hi>particulars,</hi> and then make a <hi>general Propoſition,</hi> to conſideration, touching all the three joyntly, as God ſhall aſſiſt.</p>
            <p>Firſt, concerning the immediate Call of God by <hi>voyce,</hi> or <hi>Prophet,</hi> or ſome ſuch way as God ſhall <hi>ſee meet;</hi> I know no place of <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> that doth declare, That God will no more appoint <hi>Governors as at the firſt,</hi> as he did <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Joſhua.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, This Prophecy, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 1. holdeth out much, for theſe words <hi>[as at the first, and as in the beginning]</hi> may (for ought that I know) be determined by God, to be accompliſhed in the <hi>full latitude,</hi> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as in the time of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Joſhua:</hi> That Prophecy, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.27. (in theſe words) <hi>And the Kingdom, and Dominion, and the greatneſs of the Kingdom under the whole Heaven, ſhall be given to the holy people of the moſt High:</hi> This ſeemeth to me to import, That God intendeth to do great things for his people in theſe latter times: Read <hi>Micah</hi> 7.17. <hi>According to the days of thy coming out of the Land of Egypt, I will ſhew unto him marvellous things:</hi> This (to my appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion) holds out, <hi>That God will do marvellous things;</hi> God is not limited within bounds, he can do as great things now in theſe <hi>latter times,</hi> as in the <hi>former times.</hi> Thus in other places.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I believe, That (with limitation and ſubmiſſion to Gods
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:117747:74"/> good will and pleaſure) we may ſafely preſent our humble prayers to God in the Name of his Son our bleſſed Saviour, <hi>That he would be pleaſed to appoint our chief Governor for us:</hi> The Lord was ſo far from rejecting the people, <hi>Judg.</hi> 1.1. when they ſought his gracious fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour in this particular, that he graciouſly granteth their requeſt; God doubtleſs will not be offended, when people, with the greateſt care and diligence, cleave cloſeſt to him; the Apoſtle willeth us, <hi>That in every thing our request ſhould be made known unto God by prayer and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, This way is a way that God did moſt immediately act, appoint, and practiſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and bleſs, from <hi>Moſes</hi> to <hi>Samuel,</hi> and God never repealed or contradicted this immediate way of his; <hi>God is unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able:</hi> If the people formerly caſt off God, and therefore God removed from them, and hid his face from them, they never turning to God to ſeek his face, being much hardned in their ſins; yet if God now give us hearts to repent, and to ſee the evil of them, and of our ſelves, and to turn again, and to long, and lament, with an earneſt affection, to do Gods will, without turning to the right or to the left hand, without ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding or diminiſhing; and if we do humbly and unfeignedly ſeek his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, who can tell but God may fully anſwer our <hi>petitions?</hi> God hath done already ſo much for us, in opening a way to further us in this particular, as hath not been from the days of <hi>Samuel</hi> to theſe times: I believe I may ſafely affirm it.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Conſider what a rich jewel, what a precious favour we ſhall obtain, in caſe that our good God hear our <hi>petitions,</hi> and do im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately appear in the choyce of our <hi>chief Governor,</hi> for then we ſhall be ſure to have a true Shepherd, (and not a Wolf in ſheeps clothing,) then we ſhall be certain <hi>that the good and bleſſed Spirit of GOD</hi> will reſt upon ſuch a man, (and not an <hi>evil and deceitful ſpirit,</hi>) then the people ſhall be drawn to God, (and not cauſed to forſake God,) then the people will be bleſſed of God by the means of ſuch <hi>Governors,</hi> then ſhall we obtain a man from the Lord, then ſhall <hi>we have Judges as at the firſt, and Counſellors as at the beginning:</hi> Conſider I pray you, is not this <hi>jewel,</hi> this <hi>precious favour</hi> worth the looking after? Is it not worthy our moſt <hi>fervent prayers?</hi> Have we not ſafe Rules (and clear) to warrant and to direct us to cry to God in this very caſe of <hi>Government?</hi> Did not <hi>Iſrael</hi> cry to God, and enquire of God for <hi>Governors?</hi> Did not God himſelf <hi>preſcribe</hi> and <hi>practiſe</hi> this way to chuſe <hi>Governors</hi> himſelf moſt immediately? Are we
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:117747:74"/> not commanded, <hi>that in every thing our requeſts ſhould be made known to God by Prayer and Supplication?</hi> Did ever a people return empty from <hi>God</hi> in ſuch ſeekings of <hi>God?</hi> Nay, is it not evident, that (uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, moſtly, if not always <hi>God</hi> anſwered graciouſly, and granted peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples requeſt in this very caſe of <hi>chief Governors?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Conſider further, you have endured much trouble, war, and blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed about <hi>Government,</hi> if we ſhould now fall ſhort, and miſtake in our governors, then our labor is loſt, we are undone: But on the contrary, if we obtain a man from the Lord, we ſhall have a rich re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence for all our former labors. Therefore l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t us not loſe ſuch a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious favor for want of asking at the hands of the Lord: Who can tell but <hi>God</hi> may immediately anſwer us in ſome way of his own preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing? however let us not fear, nor doubt, our prayers ſhall not be in vain, they ſhall be kept in <hi>Gods</hi> good treaſury.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, Conſider that if you ſhould miſtake in the form of <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> or in the perſons, (which muſt govern us all,) ſuch miſtakes are very hard and difficult to be amended; for when a Government and Governors are eſtabliſhed, let experience teach us, that we may ſooner be ſenſible of our miſery (which is not ordinarily taken notice of, nor truly diſcerned) then know how to be free: we may cry out, but not be able to help our ſelves. It is a long time ſince any man durſt plainly ſhew to his <hi>familiar friend,</hi> where his <hi>grievance</hi> lay, if it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned <hi>Government.</hi> Conſider it warily, and deeply, and throughly, for the glory of God, for the good of thouſands, and that your poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and your ſelves may remember with joyful hearts, how you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred <hi>Gods Preſcriptions, Gods Rules, Gods Preſidents,</hi> and <hi>the true good and ſafely</hi> of <hi>your Nation,</hi> before any other momentany, light, and vaniſhing deceiving reſpects whatſoever.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, Conſider that where people chuſe the form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Governors, they are moſt uſually miſtaken, becauſe they can diſcern no more but the outward appearance (and few amongſt many can diſcern that) they know not who God knoweth to be meet: kindred is a relation that in outward appearance is of great force; but by that means <hi>Abimelech</hi> obtained the way to Government, <hi>Judg.</hi> 9.2. <hi>Say, I pray you, in the audience of all the men of Shechem; Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber alſo that I am your bone and your fleſh.</hi> Verſ. 3. <hi>Then his mothers brethren ſpake of him, in the audience of all the men of Shechem, all theſe words; and their hearts were moved to follow Abimelech, for, ſaid they, He is our brother.</hi> But note what followed, Verſ. 23. <hi>But
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:117747:75"/> God ſent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of Shechem;</hi> There you may read what miſery and bloodſhed befell the people.</p>
            <p>I would ſhortly note three things from this Example.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That even thoſe that immoderately thirſt after Government, are uſually unmeet men.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It uſually is a means for the hurt of ſuch Governors, and uſually a means to ſhorten their own lives.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That it uſually, moſtly, proveth very bitter to thoſe very men that prefer others for by reſpects; and it is very dangerous when people venture to chuſe the principal Governor, and do not therein ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly enquire of God <hi>who ſhall be the man that ſhall govern them:</hi> And as we have many examples in this kinde; ſo, on the contrary, we ſhall finde them bleſſed that let God chuſe their <hi>Governor in chief.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But further, Remember that <hi>Samuel</hi> was miſtaken in the perſon (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt <hi>Davids</hi> brethren) fit for Government; how much ſooner may we be miſtaken? How many have been lifted to chief Governors places by kindred, by unadviſed multitudes, by fraud, by force, by eloquence, by beauty, by hypocritical pretences; Therefore I pray you ſuſpect your own hearts, lean not to your own wiſdoms; for although <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom</hi> have overſhadowed <hi>Truth</hi> from our view, for a long ſeaſon, (ſo that <hi>Truth</hi> looketh ſo ſtrangely, now we ſee it, that we can hardly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve it is <hi>Truth,</hi>) yet now I pray you let us own <hi>Truth,</hi> leſt, if he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part again out of our ſight, we ſhall not know him again: Therefore I pray you ſeek after Gods Rules of <hi>Truth,</hi> take his counſel <hi>who ſhall be our chief Governor,</hi> and this benefit will certainly follow, <hi>The good and bleſſed Spirit of God will reſt upon that man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Next concerning <hi>lots,</hi> this is a way that God himſelf preſcribed (though at ſome more diſtance) as appeareth 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> God directed <hi>Samuel</hi> that the people ſhould chuſe <hi>their chief Governor</hi> this way, namely, by <hi>lots;</hi> by which way the Lord (and not the people) did appoint their Ruler: And <hi>Samuel</hi> no doubt had reſpect to Gods preſcribed Rule, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. <hi>Thou ſhalt make him King whom the Lord thy God ſhall chuſe:</hi> whereby it appeareth evidently, that <hi>Samuel</hi> ſo under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood Gods will in <hi>that Scripture,</hi> that there was a clear difference between God chuſing a governor, and the peoples chuſing a governor; therefore he chuſeth a governor by lot, wherein and whereby <hi>God</hi> chuſeth: therefore Gods direction and inſtitution is, <hi>that God ſhall chuſe:</hi> This is moſt for <hi>Gods</hi> glory, and for the peoples greateſt ſafety. Lots are <hi>Gods</hi> own Ordinance, as appeareth in many places, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 7.17.

               <hi>So Joſhua roſe up early in the morning, and brought Iſrael by their Tribes, and the Tribe of Judah was taken: And he brought the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies of Judah, and took the family of the Zarhites, and he brought the family of the Zarhites, man by man, and Zabdi was taken: And he brought his houſhold, man by man, and Achan was taken.</hi> God could have ſhewed to <hi>Joſhua,</hi> who was the man, ſo well as he ſhewed to him that there was an offence; but he cauſeth <hi>Joſhua</hi> to enquire his will in ſuch a way as <hi>God</hi> had preſcribed: This ſheweth, that in difficult caſes God ordained that people ſhould enquire his minde by lots: and this <hi>Samuel</hi> knew, and therefore he enquireth <hi>Gods</hi> minde by lots, in this very caſe of government; this was never repealed to this day: for <hi>God</hi> is not <hi>yea</hi> and <hi>nay,</hi> God is not contrary or oppoſite to his own Rules: This is certain, it is better and ſafer for people to be directed by <hi>God</hi> to chuſe the man; yea, although <hi>God</hi> for our ſin ſhould be angry with us, yet even in thoſe cauſes it is better to fall into the hands of <hi>God,</hi> then into the hands of man; and this <hi>David</hi> well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, when he choſe to fall into the hands of God, and not into the hands of man: But further we may obſerve, That this was the uſual way (namely, by lots) that the people took, to enquire <hi>Gods</hi> minde in <hi>weighty and difficult cauſes,</hi> as appeareth, <hi>Ioſh.</hi> 18.6. <hi>I will caſt lots for you here before the Lord:</hi> thus Verſ. 8, 10. read 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.42. <hi>And Saul ſaid, caſts lots between me and Ionathan my ſon, and Iona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than was taken:</hi> Here we may ſee that God appeared, and gave a true <hi>determination,</hi> and this was a way to avoyd ſtrife: Read 1 <hi>Chro.</hi> 26.13. <hi>And they caſt lots, both ſmall and great, for the houſe of their fathers:</hi> Here again we may note, That this uſe of lots was to ſhew what Gods minde was, and to prevent all jealouſies or indirect means, and to prevent ſtrife. Read <hi>Nehem.</hi> 10.34. <hi>We caſt lots for the offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the wood, even the Prieſts, the Levites, and the People.</hi> Read <hi>Ionah</hi> 1.7. <hi>And they ſaid every one to his fellow, come and let us caſt lots, that we may know for whoſe cauſe this evil is upon us; ſo they caſt lots, and the lot fell upon Ionah:</hi> By this it evidently appeareth, that the people in weighty caſes did enquire to know Gods minde this way, namely, by lots.</p>
            <p>Secondly, We may obſerve, That God doth anſwer the people this way.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, We may obſerve, That the lot did not err, nor fail to ſhew, that which the people ſought to God for. Read <hi>Act.</hi> 1.24. <hi>And they prayed, ſaying, Thou Lord, which knoweſt the hearts of all men, ſhew whether of theſe thou haſt choſen.</hi> Verſ. 26. <hi>And they gave forth their
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:117747:76"/> lots, and the lot fell on Matthias.</hi> This ſheweth, that lots were not aboliſhed, but they are now of the ſame uſe that they were under the Law; this is an example of the Apoſtles, men in an extraordinary mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure guided by the good and holy ſpirit of God; and this was written no doubt for our learning; this was and is a clear and evident direction in the very caſe of governors, for the Apoſtles were <hi>Gods</hi> Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors, his own Witneſſes, they were the Pen-men of the <hi>holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;</hi> this matter was an <hi>eminent and a weighty matter,</hi> they choſe but one of two: The Reaſon is evident, becauſe the nature of their cauſe required no more.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Becauſe not any amongſt all, although holy, would ſerve, they muſt be men that had been the moſt noted to be eye-witneſſes of what Chriſt had done and ſuffered, and ſo that they had ſeen and heard thoſe things themſelves.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Apoſtles were preſent that had an <hi>infallible ſpirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, This cauſe differs from the <hi>Governors of a Common-wealth,</hi> becauſe <hi>God</hi> in his wiſdom ordered the <hi>Governors</hi> of <hi>a Common-wealth</hi> to be choſen by <hi>God</hi> out of all the people: and I do conceive (with due and humble reſpect to thoſe that ſhall ſee <hi>Gods minde</hi> more clearly) that it is the ſafeſt way to follow the moſt direct and evident Rules preſcribed, owned, and bleſſed by <hi>God,</hi> in the ſame caſes: Now it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appeareth, that the Prophet <hi>Samuel</hi> (directed immediately by <hi>God</hi> himſelf) did chuſe out of the whole twelve Tribes of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> by that means <hi>God</hi> did fully chuſe (according to <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. <hi>to make him Governor whom the Lord did chuſe immediately</hi>) in this very caſe of chuſing the <hi>Governor of a Common-wealth;</hi> for, in this caſe, this preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by <hi>Samuel</hi> was a certain and an approved preſident, in chuſing the perſon that <hi>God</hi> ſaw meet to be chief governor; This was not about the form of government, whether it ſhould be by <hi>Iudges,</hi> or by <hi>Kings,</hi> for of that matter <hi>God</hi> ſhewed his minde by <hi>Samuel</hi> before, expreſly witneſſing againſt the form of government by <hi>Kings:</hi> but this was a Rule to ſhew how <hi>God</hi> is ſaid to chuſe the perſon that he ſeeth meet to govern: I leave it to the conſideration of the godly.</p>
            <p>From theſe places before mentioned, firſt, I obſerve, That it plainly and clearly appeareth, that lots were ordained by <hi>God,</hi> and that <hi>God</hi> owned them, becauſe <hi>God</hi> truly appeared, and truly gave anſwer by them, and becauſe that <hi>God</hi> bleſſed this way of his own deviſing.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I obſerve, That the lot (when men caſt themſelves, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred themſelves, wholy to, or upon <hi>God,</hi> in ſuch caſes) did never err,
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:117747:76"/> it always gave a true direction, a true determination in all weighty cauſes: Search the Scriptures, and it cannot be found, that the lot ever erred. Let not as fear therefore to chuſe our chief governor by lot; for let us not doubt, <hi>God</hi> is the ſame unchangeable <hi>God, yeſterday, and to day, and the ſame for ever:</hi> Will not this way compoſe all our differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences? Will it not heal all diſtempers? Will not this way end all our ſtrife? Will not this way keep out all Wolves, and Foxes, and other beaſts of prey? Shall not we by this way return again to the Lord? and by this means <hi>God</hi> ſhall be our King, his Laws our guide; by this means we ſhall obtain a man from the Lord, and we ſhall be bleſſed, and <hi>Peace and Truth</hi> ſhall meet together; and ſo ſhall we have <hi>Iudges,</hi> in ſome proportion, <hi>as at the firſt, and Counſellers as at the beginning, and we ſhall be called a faithful City.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, Let us remember the <hi>great effuſion of blood</hi> that hath been ſhed, and the <hi>great envies, hatred, malice,</hi> that is at this day reigning in the Land; Is it not in every Country, in every City, in every Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iſh? Nay, there are but a few Families (comparatively) where there are not ſome breaches about <hi>this matter;</hi> and what the iſſue will be, the Lord knoweth: If therefore there be any <hi>bowels of pity,</hi> if you love <hi>Gods glory,</hi> if you be <hi>lovers of peace and truth,</hi> then fear not to truſt in <hi>God</hi> in <hi>this matter,</hi> God is not changed. Do we not truſt our Souls with <hi>God?</hi> and ſhall we not truſt <hi>God</hi> with our Bodies? The Lord give us underſtanding.</p>
            <p>And now I ſhal ſpeak a word to the third way of chuſing <hi>Governors,</hi> it is ſaid in ſundry places of Scripture <hi>that when the people had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten,</hi> or caſt behind them, <hi>Gods Commandements,</hi> yet <hi>even when they earneſtly ſought Gods helpe, Gods counſell, then God ſtirred or raiſed them up a Saviour, or Deliverer.</hi> The way being not ſo plainely deſcribed, where we may take notice of the peoples negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in not ſeeking to God for <hi>Governors;</hi> for at ſuch times when the people committed ſuch wickedneſſe, (we ſhall uſually find that) <hi>the State or Common-wealth, was vacant of a chiefe governor.</hi> Read Judg. 3.7. <hi>So the children of Jſrael, did wickedly in the ſight of the Lord.</hi> Ver. 9. <hi>And when the children of Iſrael cryed unto the Lord, ſtirred them up a Saviour, and he ſaved them.</hi> Ver. 10. <hi>and the Spirit of the Lord came upon him and he judged Iſrael;</hi> We may note here, <hi>that the people were negligent in inquiring of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their diſtreſſe, for a chiefe Judge, the ſtate was empty.</hi> And we may note that till they <hi>ſought the Lord,</hi> God ſuffered them to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:117747:77"/> but when they <hi>cry unto the Lord,</hi> when they <hi>do cleave to the Lord,</hi> the Lord relieveth them and ſheweth to them mercy this way, namely <hi>by ſtirring them up a chiefe governor.</hi> And further we may note, <hi>that when God putteth his ſpirit eminently in ſuch a perſon, then he judgeth Iſrael,</hi> no doubt but the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> came upon him in ſome extraordinary manner. Read Jud. 3.12. <hi>Then the children of Iſrael againe committed wickedneſſe in the ſight of the Lord.</hi> (This was after the death of their former governor) Ver. 15. <hi>And when the children of Iſrael cryed unto the Lord, the Lord ſtirred them up a Saviour, &amp;c.</hi> Jud. 4. <hi>The children of Iſrael againe committed wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi> Ver. 3. <hi>And the children of Iſrael cryed unto the Lord:</hi> and we may there read how the Lord ſhewed them favour by ſtirring up a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour. Where the Man was nominated that was their leader by the propheteſs <hi>Debora,</hi> but <hi>Debora</hi> at that time judged <hi>Iſrael<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Ver. 4. <hi>And ſo Debora by Gods appointment,</hi> I believe, <hi>judged Iſrael to the day of her Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next was <hi>Gideon, Judges</hi> 6. He was immediately called, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning divers <hi>Judges</hi> it is not ſo expreſly noted, after what manner God ſtirred them up. Whether it was by <hi>immediate Revelation,</hi> or by <hi>Prophets direction,</hi> or put <hi>his Spirit into their hearts,</hi> and made them to be notable and eminent <hi>deliverers of the people.</hi> In all ſuch dubious caſes, the ſafeſt way is to follow the moſt evident, and clear Rules, Wherein, and whereby, God doth moſt evidently preſcribe, own, and bleſſe. Now conſider, that Gods immediate call is clear without all doubt, and chuſing <hi>Governors</hi> by <hi>lot,</hi> is evident, and clear, to be a way that God himſelf preſcribed, and the <hi>lot</hi> never erred.</p>
            <p>The third way is more dubious, yet I dare not oppoſe it, where God raiſeth up a man, and maketh him an eminent deliver of his Church and people, if the people in ſuch a caſe chuſe ſuch a man to govern them, God may bleſe it, this way is left recorded in the <hi>ſacred Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> and we find that thus far God bleſſed this way, <hi>that hee made ſuch Men</hi> (ſo raiſed up, or ſtirred up by God) <hi>to become ſaviours,</hi> the people were protected, and not devoured, and the people were bleſſed with peace in their dayes, this is the neareſt way next to the former, but in any wiſe take heed not to eſtabliſh <hi>government by ſucceſſion,</hi> from Father to Son, we have taſted deep of <hi>the cup of affliction</hi> in this kind. The Father a good man, the Child otherwiſe, the Father hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one opinion, and the children another, this plainely appeareth from the Divine Records in the <hi>Sacred Scriptures,</hi> and by the late <hi>ſad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences,</hi> in this kind.</p>
            <pb n="153" facs="tcp:117747:77"/>
            <p>We may plainely ſee the bittter fruits the people reaped, by <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> from Father to Son, if we conſider and compare the fruits by <hi>Iudges,</hi> with the fruits that the people reaped by Kings, which ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by ſucceſſion; Note well, that the <hi>Government</hi> had continued from <hi>Moſes</hi> to <hi>Samuel,</hi> which was many hundred years, many <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations;</hi> and yet we ſee God ſo bleſſed theſe <hi>Iudges,</hi> that (came not in by ſucceſſion, but) were by God appointed where he ſaw meet, Read 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9.8. <hi>And the ſervant anſwered Saul againe and ſaid, behold J have found about me the fourth part of a ſhekell of ſilver</hi> (which was about five pence, Read <hi>Gen.</hi> 23.15.) <hi>that will I give the man of God to tell us our way:</hi> note well the plainneſſe, and godly humility, of the <hi>Iudges</hi> in thoſe times, that would accept of five pence.</p>
            <p>Note likewiſe, that in a ſhort time when the <hi>Government,</hi> went by <hi>ſucceſſion</hi> from Father to Son, the caſe was altered, we may note in three or foure generations, <hi>the governors built ſtately houſes, rich gardens, a thouſand Wives and Concubines, great multitudes of Charets and horſes,</hi> theſe things were directly againſt Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17, <hi>In any wiſe hee ſhall not prepare him many Horſes, neither ſhall hee take him many Wives, neither ſhall he ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther him much ſilver and gold:</hi> but we may note, that Kings quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly overtoped, and annihilated Gods Laws; This God knew, when God put <hi>a bit in the mouth of Kings, to curb their pride, Deut.</hi> 17.18, 19. namely, <hi>Gods Lawes,</hi> that ſo their hearts ſhould not be lift up: but theſe Lawes would not hould them, their hearts were above Gods Laws; God warned the People of this, the 1 of <hi>Samuel, but the People would not hear till, they cryed out under Rehoboam by reaſon of their oppreſſion,</hi> I believe a door-keeper would not now accept five pence.</p>
            <p>Dearely beloved <hi>Fathers,</hi> if you ſhould conſent to <hi>government by ſucceſſion,</hi> it might be juſt with God, to let their hearts be lift up like to <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> that God might make their little finger bigger then the former Kings loynes, the Father chaſtiſed us with rods, but the Son may with ſcourges. I pray you therefore let us have plaine, humble, bleſſed <hi>Iudges as at the firſt</hi> (not choſen <hi>by ſucceſſion</hi>) but <hi>as in the beginning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall now from theſe conſiderations make one general propoſition (and humbly lay it down at your feet, dearly beloved <hi>Fathers</hi>) which is, Conſidering the <hi>ſad and lamentable envy, emulations, ſtrife, differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,</hi>
               <pb n="154" facs="tcp:117747:78"/> that have been, and are at this day in the <hi>Nation;</hi> may it not be meet, ſolemnly, after an extraordinary manner, to humble our ſelves, and to cry unto our <hi>God</hi> for direction who ſhall be our governor? It may be, before the time (which you ſet apart for this occaſion) bee expired, God may reveal his minde in ſome extraordinary manner; but if God appear not, then let us, within ſome little conſiderate time, (before the time be ended, which God directeth you to ſet apart for this work) proceed to chuſe by lot; It is a ſafe way, it is a way God himſelf preſcribed, it never erred: Will it not be a way to remove all <hi>jealouſies</hi> and <hi>ſubtleties,</hi> and to compoſe all <hi>differences,</hi> and to put an end to all <hi>ſtrife?</hi> But, dear <hi>Fathers,</hi> I pray you however, in ſome convenient time, chuſe ſome one chief Governor, eminently known for courage and for piety, and give him all the <hi>lawful power</hi> that God in his wiſdome, gave unto <hi>Joſhua,</hi> and to other <hi>lawfull governors;</hi> This will be a way for Gods glory, and for the peoples (for us your childrens) ſafety, and comforts, for <hi>Gods Wiſdome</hi> is infinitely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all <hi>mans inventions.</hi> I pray you let us not have a Titular <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor,</hi> if you ſhall not think meet to condeſcend to any of theſe wayes, I know whom I truſt; and I hope I ſhall ſhew my ſelfe obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, in all lawfull matters, to ſuch as God, and you, ſhall ſee meet to appoint, and I ſhall not ceaſe to entreate God ſo to direct you with his <hi>good and bleſſed Spirit,</hi> that you may do that which is well pleaſing to him.</p>
            <p>Now I conceive it will be meet to ſpeak ſomething touching thoſe <hi>Governors</hi> inferior to the former, which are for the glory of God, for the eaſe of the <hi>chiefe Governor,</hi> and for the Peoples eaſe and comfort.</p>
            <p>Now again I look upon the moſt glorious, perfect, and beautifull frame of <hi>Government,</hi> which the bleſſed <hi>Angells</hi> do, (and the <hi>elect children of God</hi> ſhall) enjoy to all eternity. Where I find one bleſſed God, the governor, and the reſt all appointed and diſtributed into their ſeverall places by the power, and wiſdom, of that bleſſed God. This leadeth me to conceive, that God proportioneth his Works, like unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, for ſo God did in the <hi>Creation of the World,</hi> and the creatures therein, God made one man governor of all the creatures upon Earth, and that man named the Creatures, and diſpoſed other matters: it had bin <hi>mans happineſſe</hi> (provided that Gods glory had bin maintained) that the <hi>government of the World,</hi> might have continued in, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that lovely order. Secondly, God made that one man in
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:117747:78"/> his owne image, like to himſelfe, and I believe we ſhall finde that God compoſed, or framed the <hi>Government of his Church, and People,</hi> in ſome proportion like to the frame of the <hi>Heavenly Government:</hi> my time will not admit to ſpeake much of that <hi>bleſſed Spirit of God,</hi> part whereof God did communicate, or beſtow upon <hi>Moſes,</hi> and ſo let him repreſent his place, ſo far as might ſtand with Gods glory, that is ſo far as <hi>Moſes</hi> might be ſubject to <hi>Gods Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> for therein God reſerved to himſelfe his own glory, in <hi>Adam,</hi> the <hi>great Emperor,</hi> or <hi>governor of the World.</hi> Yet hee was ſubject to <hi>Gods Commandements;</hi> from theſe conſiderations I ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede.</p>
            <p>When God, <hi>in thoſe firſt and pureſt times</hi> did appoint the <hi>diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of governors,</hi> recorded thus, <hi>Exod</hi> 18.25. <hi>And Moſes choſe men of courage out of all Iſrael, and made them heads over the people, Rulers over thouſands, Rulers over hundreds, Rulers over fifties, and Rulers over tens.</hi> Here I finde that God gave <hi>Moſes</hi> authority, to appoint the <hi>governors,</hi> that were to govern the People. Which <hi>authority,</hi> I do believe, doth undoubtedly belong to all <hi>good gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors,</hi> being <hi>chiefe governors,</hi> onely this is to be conſidered, that the People here were ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>re to <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſo that <hi>Moſes</hi> knew many, or all of them. Therefore I believe that God, that is <hi>the God of wiſdome, and of Order,</hi> will allow, that where People live further off, and the chiefe <hi>governor</hi> may not know all the men, whoſe dwellings are further off from him, and therefore cannot ſo well know the qualifications, and fitneſſe of men for <hi>government,</hi> in ſuch caſes it doth much differ; but <hi>Moſes</hi> muſt (I meane the <hi>chiefe governor</hi> muſt doubtleſſe) approve of all <hi>governors</hi> under him, that governe for Gods glory, and for the Peoples good, eaſe, and comfort; There muſt be no <hi>inferior governor</hi> that he approveth not, for that would be directly againſt <hi>the frame of the Heavenly government,</hi> and againſt <hi>the expreſſe letter of theſe firſt, and pureſt inſtitutions.</hi> And <hi>Moſes</hi> muſt, I meane the <hi>chiefe governor</hi> muſt, chuſe immediately (if it be poſſible with convenience) the chiefe next to himſelfe, namely <hi>the governors of thouſands,</hi> this moſt nearely reſembles <hi>Gods Preſident.</hi> God choſe <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Moſes</hi> choſe them under him, the words are expreſſe, and I dare not alter them; I dare not prefer my wiſdome, before <hi>Gods Wiſdome,</hi> nor dare I add, nor diminiſh, to or from <hi>Gods Preſcriptions;</hi> the reſt of the <hi>Rulers of hundreds, fifties, and tens,</hi> may be choſen proportionable to this preſident,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:117747:79"/> (provided that the <hi>chiefe Governor</hi> approve of them.)</p>
            <p>Now that this way, is moſt for Gods glory, and the Peoples good, appeareth, if we conſider that <hi>government diſtributed</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembleth, or ſupplieth that defect of man; who cannot be every where preſent, nor here all cauſes (for otherwiſe they all repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent but one intire, and abſolute <hi>governor</hi>) therefore God appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted one <hi>chiefe governor,</hi> namely <hi>Moſes,</hi> like to himſelf; but through the occaſion of <hi>mans weakeneſſe,</hi> to ſupply that defect, God ſuffereth the <hi>Government</hi> to be diſtributed.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it appeareth that this is the beſt way, that the <hi>chiefe governor</hi> ſhould appoint (or at the leaſt approve) the reſt, becauſe the Wiſdome of God ſaw meete it ſhould be ſo, as is expreſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded.</p>
            <p>Thrdly, conſider that it doth ſtrengthen, uphold and knit to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether the whole <hi>frame of Government,</hi> forces united are the ſtrongeſt.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, it doth prevent diviſions; and may be a meanes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme abuſes, when <hi>inferiour governors</hi> are offendors, thus God when he ſeeth his Lawes broken, doth remove, and puniſh <hi>delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents.</hi> For if you ſhould admit of <hi>governors</hi> againſt the minde and approbation of the <hi>chiefe governor,</hi> it muſt needs follow, that <hi>that State</hi> ſo doing, muſt be corrupted, divided, or ſore ſhaken, and endangered, in ſhort time; for let but Gods Lawes take place, and then the <hi>governor in chiefe</hi> is ſubject alike with the reſt, and the reſt acting for God, have power to puniſh him, becauſe <hi>God is their higheſt governor,</hi> and they muſt obey God although it be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the chiefe of men. Therefore the danger cannot be great thereby, but on the contrary, it is for Gods glory, and for the peoples good, that the <hi>chiefe governor</hi> ſhould appoint, or approve of the reſt, at the leaſt.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, it will appeare to be <hi>Gods appointment,</hi> by the Records in the <hi>ſacred Scriptures,</hi> not only in the <hi>firſt institution</hi> (which is the beſt, and the ſureſt) but alſo in the <hi>continued practice</hi> of <hi>chiefe governors,</hi> all along, from time to time. This appeares <hi>Ioſhua</hi> 1.17. As <hi>we obeyed Moſes in all things, ſo we will obey thee,</hi> but <hi>Moſes</hi> had the <hi>authority,</hi> to appoint <hi>governors;</hi> therefore <hi>Ioſhua</hi> had ſo, and it appeareth by <hi>Ioſhua</hi> his actings afterwards.</p>
            <p>Thus we may reade that <hi>Saul,</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> did appoint <hi>gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors,</hi> recorded in many places, and ſo did the <hi>Governors,</hi> and the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Iuda.</hi>

            <pb n="157" facs="tcp:117747:79"/>
            <p>I ſhall refer <hi>theſe matters</hi> to the conſideration of the godly, and of the learned, if any luſt to be contentious; I ſtrive not to contend, but contend to bee quiet, and ſeeke for <hi>Peace,</hi> and <hi>Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now I conceive it is requiſite to ſpeake a word, touching the <hi>Lawyers.</hi> Gods Lawes if we obſerve them well, are pithy, and ſhort, they are contained in a little roome, if we ſubſtract the <hi>Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall matters,</hi> (or matter which ſhew Gods actings, and mans actings, which are not ſo properly Lawes, but rather ſhew Gods glory, and mans converſation) from the <hi>direct Commandements of God;</hi> in what a <hi>little volume,</hi> would <hi>Gods Lawes</hi> be contained? which ſheweth the <hi>purity,</hi> and <hi>excellency</hi> of them, of <hi>Gods Lawes.</hi>

            <p>The Lawes of ſome Countries containe <hi>great Bookes</hi> or <hi>Volumes</hi> in compariſon of <hi>Gods Lawes,</hi> many <hi>Lawyers</hi> looke much upon the <hi>Letter of the common Lawes,</hi> I would there were many more look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed faithfully to the <hi>true meaning of thoſe Lawes,</hi> contained in the <hi>Sacred Word of God.</hi> We reade but little of other Lawes, during the times of the <hi>Iudges of Iſrael;</hi> I do believe that the <hi>multitude of Lawes</hi> did originally ſpring, from the <hi>iniquity of the Lawyers,</hi> and from the <hi>iniquity of the People,</hi> ſcarce any words were ſufficient, ſo to expreſſe the truth, but either the Judge, or the Lawyer or the People, would break through the Law; I believe there is juſt cauſe of ſorrow, and of ſhame, to conſider it.</p>
            <p>The beſt way (that I know) to reforme this, is to keepe cloſeſt to <hi>the true Originall,</hi> which is the <hi>moſt true, perfect, and clear rule, and is the rule of all rules;</hi> becauſe all other rules, are but derivatives from thence.</p>
            <p>Doubtleſſe our Lawes ought to be as few as may be, and thoſe Lawes diſtributed into ſuch ſeverall places, where the People dwel, ſuch as do concern thoſe People, in thoſe parts, for the Peoples eaſe, and comfort.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the Lawes ought to be in our <hi>own language,</hi> ſo as the People may reade, and obſerve them; becauſe God doth afford that benefit to the People, in the giving, and publiſhing his Lawes, which are of the moſt excellency. And if we conſider the end why <hi>Iudges</hi> were multiplied, as Gods glory, was the chiefe, ſo likewiſe the Peoples eaſe, and comfort is expreſſed: ſo ought it to be in thoſe Lawes that are <hi>branches of Gods Lawes,</hi> as Gods glory is the higheſt,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:117747:80"/> and true end of them, ſo likewiſe the Peoples eaſe and comfort, by, and from them, is to be reſpected. A great helpe, both for Gods glory, and for the Peoples comfort, is to have <hi>good, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Iudges;</hi> for ſuch will not (ſo much) ſeeke themſelves, (which is truely to deſtroy themſelves) as they will ſeeke Gods glory, and the Peoples good. Theſe things have bin mightily perverted, yet God hath not left us without hope, but that God will <hi>reſtore Iudges as at the firſt, and counſellers, as at the beginning, then ſhall we be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a City of righteouſneſſe, a faithfull City.</hi>
            </p>

I account it to be a matter of no ſmall moment to write <hi>any Booke,</hi> neither had I written, if I had not believed God called me to it, (of my ſelfe I can do no good matter) but this <hi>J</hi> do believe that in this writing contained in this <hi>Booke,</hi> I am ſtrengthened, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected and guided by <hi>the good and bleſſed Spirit of the true and ever-living God,</hi> To whom I deſire to acknowledge and give, as is Gods due, and my duty, <hi>all praiſe, and ſervice, glory, and honor, and power,</hi> becauſe God is worthy of it, for he hath created all things, and for his Wills ſake, they are, and have bin created. <hi>Rev.</hi> 4.11.</p>

            <p>I would firſt ſay to them that unfeignedly deſire to do Gods Will, though in <hi>ſome matters,</hi> ſome having <hi>larger talents</hi> then others, there be difference in <hi>their judgements,</hi> (although in <hi>many matters</hi> the difference being throughly, and truely conſidered, is more in <hi>ſhew</hi> then in <hi>reall ſubstance</hi>): would you take the beſt and ſafeſt way? Then begin in the right manner, and place, <hi>labour to streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, and encourage this preſent government,</hi> who, I believe, many of them, do humbly, cordially and unfeinedly deſire to do Gods good Will; <hi>now ſtand ſtill, and ſee the ſalvation of God,</hi> proceede regularly, pray earneſtly to God for them, that <hi>the good Spirit of his grace may leade them into all truth,</hi> for doubtleſſe, in their peace your peace and proſperity in a great meaſure is contained.

            </p>
            <p>Note I pray you, what a direct oppoſition there is between the <hi>Babylon of confuſion,</hi> and <hi>this City ruled, and proportioned by the Wiſdome of God;</hi> you know that <hi>Babells Tower brought confuſion</hi> at the firſt building, and from that day to this, that <hi>great ſtrumpet</hi> is corrupted, and defiled, by forſaking <hi>Gods bleſſed Rules</hi> recorded, <hi>ſhe ſlighted Gods Wiſdome, ſhee would not follow his Preſcriptions,</hi> but <hi>turned from God, and followed her owne inventions.</hi> Therefore <hi>ſhee not being trimmed as a Bride prepared for ſuch a glorious God, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing jealous of his glory, doth give her a Bill of divorce, for her adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:</hi> let this ſerve for to warn us to follow <hi>Gods Preſcriptions, his Rules and Preſidents</hi> recorded in the <hi>Word of truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Note it well the maine end of the <hi>Creation</hi> of <hi>Heaven, Earth, Man</hi> and the reſt of <hi>the Creatures,</hi> was, and is, <hi>that man may learn to ſee the difference betweene Gods good government, and evill go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments; betweene Gods Wiſdome contained in the ſacred Rules of Gods holy Word, and between mans ſeeming better inventions, contrived by mans own wiſdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Is not this the leſſon that God teacheth us from our <hi>cradle</hi> to ur <hi>deat?</hi> Obſerve well, God letteth us ſee the difference between <hi>his Government</hi> recorded and preſcribed in <hi>his Word of Truth,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween

            <p>Conſider what is the main, the very end of Gods actings, and mans actings, all our proſperity, our ſufferngs, all our afflictions; is not this the very moving cauſe, and the higheſt end? To teach us, that it is ſafeſt, and moſt for our comfort, that we ſhould follow thoſe Rules preſcribed by God, without turning aſide to any hand, or upon any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and eſpecially in <hi>this weighty matter</hi> of <hi>Governors</hi> and <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> God looketh upon this with a wary and with a jealous eye, he knowing of what neer concernment it is, for his glory, and mans good; Therefore when the people went about but to alter the form of <hi>govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> by himſelf preſcribed, in what high contempt doth God take this? He ſaith, That <hi>the people had caſt God away from governing and reigning over them,</hi> in ſo doing.</p>
            <p>Conſider, do but take away two things, namely good Governors, and Gods good Rules of direction, contained in his ſacred Word, and this world, the people in it, would be turned into a confuſed Chaos, a heap of rubbiſh, of ruinous deſolations, much worſe then that Chaos recorded <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. <hi>When in the beginning the Earth was voyd, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out form, and in darkneſs.</hi> Witneſs divers Nations that at this day have not Gods Laws, his bleſſed Word to govern them, but have evil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors; in ſuch places it is certain and true, they do degenerate ſo much from goodneſs, that the ſtrongeſt captivateth and oppreſſeth the weaker, and they do devour one another, yea, they ſell mens fleſh, and womens, and childrens fleſh, as we do buy and ſell beef in the ſhambles. Dearly beloved, we are the very ſame by nature, were it not that we ſubmit to the <hi>Government</hi> of a good and bleſſed <hi>God,</hi> and to his Laws, and to his bleſſed Rules. Therefore now I pray you to ſet a high price upon Government, good <hi>Government,</hi> for <hi>God</hi> loveth to beſtow the
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:117747:84"/> richeſt and choyceſt mercies upon thoſe that value them according to their true worth; he will not proſtitute ſuch rich jewels, ſuch precious favors, unto ſuch a people as make <hi>light account</hi> of them, for <hi>ſwine will trample upon pearls of the greateſt value;</hi> but <hi>God giveth Grace to the humble, and to the thirſty:</hi> by the hungry food is thankfully and gladly accepted, but the full loatheth the hony comb; <hi>Iſrael was wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, they ſlighted Gods form of Government, and thoſe good Governors that were the moſt immediately appointed by God himſelf;</hi> therefore God maketh them to ſee the difference, he maketh them <hi>ſervants</hi> to ſerve <hi>ſtrangers</hi> in a <hi>ſtrange Land, in hunger, and cold, and nakedneſs, and oppreſſed, and in the want of all things;</hi> the Lord reach us inſtruction.</p>
            <p>Therefore now, dearly beloved <hi>Fathers,</hi> joyne all your hearts, and endeavours together for Gods glory, ſet aſide, caſt behinde you, all <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berances,</hi> all <hi>by-reſpects,</hi> tread under your feete <hi>theſe ſublunary mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> in compariſon of Gods glory, the good of your Nation, the good of your ſelves, and of your (and our) poſterity: conſider that <hi>Satan</hi> tempted our <hi>bleſſed Saviour</hi> with the ſeeming ſhew of theſe, empty, deceiptefull, deadly, lying Serpents, namely <hi>making a ſhew of that to be found in worldly honors, and preferments, which is not to be found in them, if Satan</hi> laboured with <hi>Chriſt</hi> (much more with his <hi>Diſciples</hi>) to perſwade <hi>that theſe earthly things are more worth then Gods favour;</hi> for the ſhew of theſe, which were not his to give, laboured <hi>to draw Christ from God;</hi> Therefore (in compariſon) caſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde you, under your feet, <hi>theſe venomous Cockatrices Egges of worldly honors,</hi> let them not be preferred before Gods commands. For <hi>theſe deceiptfull ſhewes of theſe momentany vanities, do deceitfully worke too much upon our affections, to leade us aſide (out of that good way that leadeth to true bleſſedneſſe) into that broad path that many great and wordly rich men do walke in, which leadeth to certain Deſtruction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I believe, amongſt you that now govern <hi>this Common-wealth,</hi> there are of Gods <hi>precious ſervants,</hi> that do truely, and unfeignedly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, and deſire to do Gods Will; well then, here is a <hi>precious opportunity,</hi> for if you ſhould ſtudy all your life, to do an act well pleaſing to God, this is the very act (being an act concerning theſe worldly matters) that is acceptable to God; namely, <hi>to follow Gods choiſeſt Rules of direction, (with all your heart, with all diligence) in the matter of the form of government, and the perſons to be governors, that ſo Gods bleſſed Spirit may reſt upon them.</hi>

            <p>For conſider that if you miſtake, or turne aſide from Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, and ſo do miſtake in the forme, and perſons, we are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, the glory and ſplendor of your labours are loſt, for if the perſon of our chiefe <hi>Governor</hi> be not choſen exactly, according to <hi>the choiſeſt Rules,</hi> gathered out of <hi>the bleſſed, and good Word of our God,</hi> how ſhall we, the People, <hi>lie downe and reſt in peace, without trouble, and feare?</hi> for we know that in by-pathes <hi>Wolves and Foxes</hi> do come into the <hi>Sheepfold,</hi> which although they ſhould come ſoftly to us, as if they meant us no hurt, yet our <hi>hearts</hi> cannot be quiet, for <hi>Wolves,</hi> and <hi>Foxes,</hi> meane us no good. Nay further, if they ſhould come diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed in <hi>ſheeps clothing,</hi> ſo that we know them not by outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, yet if any ſhould come in by any <hi>indirect means</hi> (which <hi>God</hi> forbid) in thoſe paths <hi>thoſe beaſts of prey</hi> come in, certainly our <hi>hearts</hi> cannot be ſecurely and contentedly quiet, becauſe we ſhall look back upon <hi>former experiences,</hi> recorded in the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> where we may finde, <hi>that ſuch men as have attained to the places of chief Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors, not in a way of God, upon ſuch perſons God hath not beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his good (but an evil) ſpirit; and ſuch perſons have proved to draw the people to ſin, and have been a means to bring the fierce wrath of God upon the people.</hi> Therefore I do ſeriouſly confeſs (in the preſence of our glorious God) that when I do conſider <hi>the great danger, weight and charge of a chief Governors place,</hi> I ſee no cauſe (in any worldly reſpect that is truly real and ſubſtantial) why any man ſhould covet, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, or thirſt after it: but contrarily, conſidering the <hi>great charge of ſouls, the great account they muſt give to God;</hi> for <hi>to whom much, many Talents are given, of them much ſhall be required;</hi> God is a jealous God of his honor: Conſidering likewiſe the ſhortneſs of our lives, being but even (comparatively) a moment; and conſidering likewiſe the danger that attendeth men in eminent places, they are ſet in ſlippery places; and conſidering likewiſe what diligence God requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, and ſelf-denial, in ſuch places, To me it plainly appeareth, <hi>That a quiet or peaceably life (with competency) is much to be preferred, and is truly and ſolidly better, for a mans own comfort.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Gideon</hi> are recorded in Gods Records for their humility and wiſdom, and for that they looked upon places of charge.
